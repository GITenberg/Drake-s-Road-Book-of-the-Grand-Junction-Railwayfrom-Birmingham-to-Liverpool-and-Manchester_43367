the First Edition of the Grand Junction Road Book, and the
substantial proofs of approbation which a rapid sale has
afforded, render it a duty as proper as it is pleasant, for the

containing lists of public buildings; institutions of all kinds;
places of worship of all denominations, with names of the
officiating ministers; principal show rooms and manufactories;
times of arrival and departure of mails at the post office;
hackney coach fares; bankers, inns, boarding houses, omnibus
offices, newspapers, canal conveyances, waggon warehouses,
packets, &amp;c., &amp;c., for Birmingham, Manchester, and
Liverpool.&nbsp; The exceeding utility of this new division of
the volume will be obvious to every one.&nbsp; The Map has also
been revised, and greatly improved; and the &ldquo;<span

its bow to the public, in full expectation that its old fame and

BIRMINGHAM.</h2>
<p

BUILDINGS AND INSTITUTIONS, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> native town of <span
class="smcap">Birmingham</span>, of whose celebrity and
importance we are justly proud, demands our first attention in
this our Itinerary; although the numerous publications which give
more circumstantial particulars respecting it than the brief
limits of the present work will admit, render it an unnecessary
task here to occupy many pages with our notice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In our after topography and history of towns on the
&ldquo;Grand Junction&rdquo; line, we shall have occasion to
allude to their several claims to the honours of &ldquo;hoar
antiquity;&rdquo; but none it would appear can boast of more
remote fame than our own brave old town of Birmingham, or, as it
has been variously written, <i>Bromycham</i>, <i>Bremecham</i>,
<i>Bermyngham</i>, and <i>Bromnsycham</i>, the etymology of which
terms have served to puzzle the learned in such lore for years
gone by, and will do for years to come.&nbsp; What never can be
positively settled, always proves a most fascinating subject for
argument.&nbsp; Mr. Hutton, the antiquary, imagines the
derivation to <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>be this: <i>wich</i>, or <i>wick</i>, being used to
signify a town or village, and <i>brom</i>, from the <i>broom</i>
growing in the vicinity.&nbsp; But we must leave the subject for
more voluminous writers.&nbsp; The late Mr. Hamper, our especial
antiquary, traced the orthography through no less than <i>one
hundred and forty</i> variations.&nbsp; In proof of Birmingham
being a place of no very recent creation, the prodigious
accumulation of scoria produced by the smelting of iron, at Aston
furnace, may be referred to; as also the great number of
exhausted coal mines, on a large common within a few miles,
called Wednesbury Old Field.&nbsp; Both these must have been the
work of many centuries, as is proved by the fact, that in the
former, the mass of scoria has not perceptibly increased within
the memory of that remarkable individual, &ldquo;the oldest
inhabitant,&rdquo; though constantly receiving additions.&nbsp;
It appears that the Britons were acquainted with the use and
manufacture of iron previously to the Roman conquest, as they are
described with chariots armed with scythes.&nbsp; It requires no
very great stretch of imagination to suppose Birmingham (the
<i>Bremenium</i> of the Romans) to have been a chief station for
the fabrication of such weapons.&nbsp; In Doomsday Book,
&ldquo;<i>Bermengeham</i>&rdquo; is noticed; and the manor and
lordship were held by the De Birmingham family and their
ancestors, during the reigns from Henry I. to Henry VIII., when
John Dudley, afterwards Duke of Northumberland, being in
possession of Dudley, and desirous of adding to it the manor of
Birmingham, contrived, by a series of villanous artifices and
perjury, to wrest it from Edward de Birmingham, and add it to his
own possessions.&nbsp; On the <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>attainder and execution of the duke,
in the reign of Mary, the manor escheated to the crown; and in
1643 a descendant of the family, through the female line, was
raised to the peerage, by the title of Baron Ward, of Birmingham,
changed afterwards to Viscount Dudley and Ward, and Earl of
Dudley.&nbsp; The remains of the ancient manor house have long
been removed to make way for improvements; its former name,
&ldquo;The Moat,&rdquo; (now called Smithfield,) and two
neglected effigies in St. Martin&rsquo;s church, of a crusader
and an ecclesiastic of the De Birmingham family, are all that
remain to tell of their former greatness.&nbsp; Few historical
events seem to have disturbed the good people of Birmingham
except the civil war of the seventeenth century, when they proved
themselves staunch adherents to the parliamentarians, and did
good service to their partizans, against Prince Rupert and his
troops, at which time some earth works thrown up at Bordesley,
conferred the name of Camp Hill on a part of it.&nbsp; The prince
afterwards set fire to the town, but obligingly desisted from
further demonstration of such warm regard, on being handsomely
bribed to that effect.&nbsp; The riots of 1791 are so frequently
brought to the minds of our town&rsquo;s people by present
allusions, that it needs not to dwell here on the disgraceful
theme.&nbsp; Turning to a pleasanter topic, we will briefly
glance at the manufactures which made an anonymous poet formerly
exclaim,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s grand toy-shop, art&rsquo;s
exhaustless mine&mdash;<br />
These, and more titles, Birmingham, are thine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is amusing to look back to the condition of <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Birmingham in
Leland&rsquo;s time, (Henry VIII.,) who describes it as inhabited
only &ldquo;by smithes that use to make knives and all manner of
cutting tools, and lorimers that make bittes, and a great many
nailors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Camden, in the reign of Elizabeth, speaks
of it as &ldquo;swarming with inhabitants, and echoing with the
noise of anvils; but the upper part rising with abundance of
handsome buildings;&rdquo; and his continuator, Bishop Gibson, in
the reign of Anne, mentions &ldquo;its artificers in iron and
steel, whose performances in that way are greatly admired both at
home and abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prior to the restoration of Charles
II. the town only consisted of one long street, extending from
the hamlet of Deritend to the present Bull-street, and contained
barely 5,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; <i>Now</i>, the probably correct
amount would stand thus: streets, 340; houses, 22,000;
population, 200,000.&nbsp; Birmingham was created a borough by
the Reform Bill, and sends two members to parliament.&nbsp; The
honours of a mayor and corporation are now added to its civil
dignities.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the almost innumerable branches of trade and manufacture
at present carried on, are light and heavy steel goods, (here
called toys,) brass and iron foundery, sadlery, military
accoutrements, fire-arms, swords and cutlery of various kinds;
jewellery, gold, silver, and plated goods; buttons, medals,
japannery; gilt, silver, ivory, bone, and other toys; glass,
wood-turnery, metal-rolling, tools and implements of all kinds;
mill machinery of all sorts, and steam engines on every known
principle.&nbsp; Casting, modelling, die-sinking, engraving, and
other processes connected <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>with the various manufactures have
been brought to the greatest perfection; also the cutting of
glass, of which there are many brilliant specimens in the
show-rooms of the town, especially those of Messrs. Rollason,
Price, Henderson, Mrs. Bedford&rsquo;s, &amp;c.&nbsp; The great
establishment at the Soho, near Birmingham, is intimately
connected with its manufacturing interests, as under the
superintendence of Messrs. Boulton and Watt, great improvements
were effected in all kinds of machinery, and the power of steam
applied to every mechanical purpose.&nbsp; From their ingenious
coining mill, the greater part of the copper money of George III.
was issued.&nbsp; Mr. Boulton died in 1809, aged eighty-one, and
Mr. Watt in 1819, aged eighty-three.&nbsp; They were both
interred in Handsworth church, where a marble bust commemorates
the former, and a statue, by Chantrey, the latter.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the magnificent show-rooms of Mr. G. R. Collis
in Church-street, (formerly Sir E. Thomason&rsquo;s,) splendid
specimens of the chief native manufactures are collected, and
their mode of manufacture shown to all respectable
visitors.&nbsp; Mr. Phipson&rsquo;s pin manufactory, which in
this seemingly small article employs so great a number as one
thousand persons, is another large establishment; and the
articles of oriental gorgeousness and diversity, displayed by
Messrs. Jennens and Betteridge, at their japanned ware and papier
mach&eacute; manufactory, in Constitution-hill, are full of
brilliant designs and adornment.&nbsp; The show-rooms of Messrs.
Mapplebeck and Lowe, Osborne, and others, contain a great variety
of hardware and cutlery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of ponderous machinery, none perhaps is more interesting than
that of the metal rolling mills; there is positive grandeur in
the great power employed, and <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the accuracy with which it is adjusted
to the end required.&nbsp; The button manufacture is a principal
source of wealth to the town, and many of its chief families may
trace back their origin (their <i>honourable</i> origin&mdash;far
more truly honourable than the anxiety occasionally shown by
present full-blown importance to disguise it) to a humble
fabricator of these small and indispensable articles.&nbsp; They
are made of all kinds and descriptions, to suit all markets; as
were buckles likewise, some years since; but fashion, that mighty
revolutionist, has driven them from their once prominent station
in the toilet of the exquisite of former days; and knees and
shoes, and dainty spangled and high heeled slippers, fit for
feminine feet, have all laid by the buckles which used to glitter
in cut steel and silver delicately worked, or set with
brilliants; and of so comely dimensions, as well nigh to cover
the pretty insteps of our grandmothers.&nbsp; As a source of
great wealth to our native town, we must regret the abolition of
ornamental buckles.&nbsp; Steel tools, and lighter, tasteful
articles, form another great branch.&nbsp; The first steel-house,
or factory, gave the name &ldquo;Steelhouse-lane&rdquo; to the
street.&nbsp; Guns were first made in the reign of William III.,
and in times of war have constituted an important part of our
trade.&nbsp; Silver, brass, and iron are all wrought to a great
extent, in every known variety of manufacture.&nbsp; To enumerate
<i>all</i> the productions of Birmingham were nearly an
impossible task, had we space; as it is, we must rest here, and
proceed to notice a few of the chief buildings and institutions
which would attract the observation of a stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p7.jpg">
<img alt=
"Birmingham Town Hall"
title=
"Birmingham Town Hall"
src="images/p7.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>First, of
the first class, ranks our noble and magnificent Town Hall, in
Paradise-street, a Grecian temple of the Corinthian order,
standing on a rustic basement, and built of marble from
Anglesea.&nbsp; It is of recent erection; from the design, and
under the direction of Mr. J. Hansom, of Hinckley, and contains a
splendid hall, 140 feet long, by 65 feet wide, and 65 feet high,
adapted for great public meetings, and for the performances of
music at the Triennial Festivals; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> it also contains
spacious saloons, committee rooms, etc.&nbsp; Its organ is the
finest in the kingdom.&nbsp; The new Free Grammar School, in
New-street, is a large and handsome building, in the Gothic
style, from a design by Mr. Barry, of London.&nbsp; The
exhibition rooms of the Birmingham Society of Arts, New-street,
form a handsome building, admirably adapted for the purpose; and
the annual exhibition, of ancient and modern masters, is inferior
to no provincial one.&nbsp; Another spacious suite of rooms was
erected a few years since, by a dissentient party of the artists;
but, having returned to the parent institution, their gallery
since has been occupied by the highly interesting, valuable, and
well-arranged Museum of Natural History, collected by Mr. Weaver,
in the various branches of geology, ornithology, entomology,
mineralogy, conchology, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Royal School of
Medicine and Surgery, in Paradise-street, have now purchased this
splendid collection, which, joined to the one they already
possess, will form one of the finest Museums in the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>provinces.&nbsp; It is liberally supported and patronised
by the neighbouring nobility and county families.&nbsp; The
General Hospital, Blue Coat School, Dispensary, and Asylums, are
worthy of all praise for their essential utility as
charities.&nbsp; The former is mainly supported by the proceeds
of the Triennial Festivals; the others by liberal subscriptions,
with which the inhabitants of Birmingham appear ever ready to
increase the usefulness of charities having for their end the
alleviation of misery, in whatever form it exists.&nbsp; The new
Market Hall, extending from the Bull-ring to Worcester-street, is
a spacious and commodious building, though the internal
arrangement might be greatly improved, by a little more attention
to order and neatness on the part of the various trades-people
who have stalls there.&nbsp; The market having formerly been held
in the open street, may, in some degree, account for this.&nbsp;
Nearly opposite the hall stands a statue of Lord Nelson, by
Westmacott, with a miniature man-of-war beside him, on a pedestal
surrounded by an iron rail and lamps.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Churches most remarkable for architectural beauty, are,
St. Philip&rsquo;s, in the Doric style, with a graceful tower and
cupola: Trinity Church, Bordesley, designed by Mr. F. Goodwin,
much in the style of King&rsquo;s College Chapel, Cambridge; it
is a fine example of the Ecclesiastical Gothic: St.
George&rsquo;s, also Gothic, but of far inferior beauty; St.
Martin&rsquo;s, which <i>has</i> been a fine old edifice, with a
tapering spire, but is now disfigured by a brick shell: St.
Paul&rsquo;s, Christ Church, St. Thomas&rsquo;s, St.
Peter&rsquo;s, St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, St. Mary&rsquo;s, All
Saints&rsquo;, and others are of less striking appearance.&nbsp;
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Many of the
dissenting congregations have handsome and spacious
meeting-houses and chapels, particularly the Catholic Chapels;
Unitarian Meeting-houses; Independent Meeting-house,
Carr&rsquo;s-lane; Mount Zion Chapel; Scottish Kirk,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Schools are connected with all, and with the
numerous National, Lancasterian, Infant, and other schools,
combine in distributing knowledge, in however a small degree as
yet, among the useful and industrious classes.&nbsp; The
excellent school for the instruction of Deaf and Dumb children is
pleasantly situated at Edgbaston: there are also various Asylums
for the young, the helpless, and the immoral (repentant, of
course).</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Old Library, in Union-street, contains a valuable
collection of 40,000 volumes, and commodious reading rooms.&nbsp;
The New Library, in Temple-row, is a more recent and smaller
establishment.&nbsp; Divers conglomerations of novels, called
&ldquo;Circulating Libraries,&rdquo; also exist for the benefit
of the sentimental.&nbsp; The Philosophical Institution has a
convenient Lecture-Theatre and Museum in Cannon-street, with a
resident Curator.&nbsp; Subscribers have the privilege of
introducing strangers to the lectures.&nbsp; The members of the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institution at present have lectures in the same
building, until the erection of one suitable for them.&nbsp;
Strangers are admitted to the Mechanics&rsquo; lectures on
payment of one shilling.&nbsp; The Botanical and Horticultural
Society have extensive gardens and conservatories at Edgbaston,
situated on rising ground, and commanding a beautiful and
richly-wooded expanse of scenery.&nbsp; The exhibitions of
plants, fruits, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&amp;c., when a brilliant company generally assembles,
are scenes of great gaiety.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Conservatories and Greenhouses, are the
erection of Mr. T. Clark, of Lionel-street, Birmingham, whose
manufactory for Metallic Hothouses, &amp;c., is very
extensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Cemetery has been recently laid out and planted on the north
side of the town, at Key Hill, where a large excavation in a hill
of gravel renders the spot striking and even picturesque: a neat
Chapel is erected for the performance of the funeral service.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1813 an Act of Parliament was obtained for the erection of
a Proof House for all fire-arms made in the town, which are
subjected to a very severe test.&nbsp; The hall and other
premises are in Banbury-street, and have quite a military and
formidable appearance.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The News Room, on Bennett&rsquo;s-hill, and the different
banking establishments, are handsome buildings, many of them of
considerable architectural beauty.&nbsp; The Theatre is large,
and inferior to few out of the metropolis, though the indifferent
encouragement given to the drama in Birmingham, causes it to be
comparatively but little used.&nbsp; It is capable of
accommodating 2,500 persons, and contains to the front, a suite
of Assembly Rooms, Billiard and Coffee Rooms, &amp;c.&nbsp; There
were formerly two smaller theatres, and an amphitheatre for
equestrian performances, all three of which have been converted
from their dissolute ways, and become pious and holy conventicles
for divine worship.&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Temporary amphitheatres have
frequently been erected since, and a permanent one is in
progress.&nbsp; For more circumstantial particulars and
descriptions of these and other edifices, we must refer our
readers to the &ldquo;Picture of Birmingham,&rdquo; <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> or other more lengthy histories.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The environs of the town, especially Edgbaston and Harborne,
contain many tasteful residences, erected by the wealthier
merchants and tradesmen; whose pretty suburban villas have all
gardens and pleasure grounds attached.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood
of Birmingham are many fine old houses, or halls, as they are
called, well deserving of a visit from the antiquary or artist;
and the far famed glories of Warwick, Kenilworth,
Shakespeare-sainted Stratford, Guy&rsquo;s Cliff, and other
places of renown, are within a short drive.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this brief survey of the past and present condition of
Birmingham, it will be seen how rapidly its greatness and
importance have been achieved by the perseverance, spirit, and
ingenuity of its inhabitants.&nbsp; We may expect as rapid, and
almost as great improvements from the additional consequence and
advantages it will receive from the great works now nearly
completed.&nbsp; The finished line of railway from London to
Liverpool through this place, may, with confidence, be looked to
as another great era in its history, from whence to date still
increasing wealth, power, and intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Birmingham Station of the Grand
Junction railway, closely adjoins that of the London and
Birmingham, which greatly facilitates the arrangements of
travellers proceeding along the entire line.&nbsp; Until the
completion of the permanent buildings, those at Vauxhall have
been temporarily used.&nbsp; To a stranger coming into the
station-yard for the first time, the whole scene is one of great
novelty: the long train of treble-bodied coaches, waiting under a
broad covered way for passengers and baggage; the bustle and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>animation of
the host of porters, guards, conductors, &amp;c.; the amazement
depicted on some of the faces of the lookers-on; the state of
&ldquo;intellectual complication&rdquo; evinced by others,
especially those who, having various items of property to convey
with them, are tremblingly solicitous for the welfare of sundry
&ldquo;red-striped carpet bags, trunks with wrappering
over,&rdquo; bandboxes which will be ruined by a drop of rain,
and fish-baskets which have a mortal antipathy to be
squeezed.&nbsp; Other important-looking passengers make up their
minds to take things as a matter of course, and not betray any
vulgar surprise; and from their extremely over-done
<i>nonchalance</i>, would fain persuade you they had made a
journey round the globe in a first-rate train, and reached the
antipodes by a tunnel.&nbsp; These valiant and adventurous
individuals are by far the severest sufferers by the
anti-cigar-act, passed by the Company, for which the unsmoking
part of the community, especially the fair sex, are greatly
indebted.&nbsp; The traveller may refer to the company&rsquo;s
regulations at full, in the appendix at the end of this
volume.&nbsp; Supposing all preliminaries adjusted, we commence
our journey.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Passing the station at Vauxhall, (closely adjoining to which
are Vauxhall Gardens,) the railroad proceeds by Duddeston, and
passes over the Coleshill road near Saltley Chapel, a small
pigeon-house like edifice to the E. of the line.&nbsp; Aston
Church soon appears on the W., above the rich woods surrounding
it; and the high chimney of the Birmingham Water Works (lately
established to supply the town) is passed on the E.&nbsp; The
steam engines, Hercules and Atlas, erected here for <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>pumping the
water from the reservoir, into the pipes for conveyance to
Birmingham, are perhaps the grandest and most perfect of their
kind ever fabricated.&nbsp; Yardley Village and Perry Barr form
the distant view.&nbsp; The railroad now passes over the Aston
embankment, and a viaduct of ten arches, beneath which runs the
high road to Sutton, and the Fazeley Canal.&nbsp; From this point
the last view is gained of the town of Birmingham, on the W.; and
on the E. a prospect of Gravelly Hill, now nearly levelled, and
the village of Erdington.&nbsp; A short distance onwards the line
passes the front of Aston Hall, a fine old baronial residence in
the Elizabethan style of architecture, erected by Sir Thomas Holt
in 1620, and in which he entertained Charles I. previously to the
battle of Edge Hill.&nbsp; It is situated in a fine park, richly
ornamented with stately timber of ancient growth, and thriving
modern plantations.&nbsp; All the views of this fine old mansion
are strikingly beautiful; but the one commanded from the railroad
line, looking up the avenue of lofty elms, (which the line
crosses,) is the most imposing.</p>
<blockquote><p>James Watt, Esq., the present proprietor, has, it
is said, expended &pound;10,000 in preventing the line of
railroad from passing through his park, which the Company
intended it to do; and in consequence of this opposition a great
curve appears in the course of the line at this part.&nbsp; Iron
works in the neighbourhood have been in operation from remote
antiquity. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
Church, which re-appears at several points of the line, is a
beautiful and venerable structure, with a fine tapering spire,
and remarkably musical bells, the sweet tones of which will
scarcely reach the ears of railroad travellers.&nbsp; Part of the
village of Aston is observable from the railroad, and also the
grounds and fish-pans of its &ldquo;Tavern,&rdquo; a spot much
frequented by tea (and ale) drinking parties from Birmingham.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One very agreeable feature of the scenery on the line, is the
unspoiled freshness and verdure of the ground on either
side.&nbsp; The idea most persons entertain respecting such
astounding innovations on ancient usages as steam carriages and
railroads is, that they spread desolation around their path, and
that the track of a locomotive engine must necessarily be as
devastating in its effects as that of a lava course.&nbsp; We
candidly confess to something akin to this suspicion
ourselves.&nbsp; But all &ldquo;Grand Junction&rdquo; patrons
must be gratified to find such expectations disappointed so
pleasingly in the cheerful aspect of the fields, groves, and
&ldquo;little running brooks,&rdquo; closely bordering the
excavations or embankments.&nbsp; Cattle are quietly feeding just
on the other side the fence, and gay wildflowers already enamel
the newly-made banks.&nbsp; Sometimes, certainly, a horse or cow
may be abruptly interrupted in a quiet meditation by the rapid
rushing by of a &ldquo;Centaur&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alecto,&rdquo;
with its lengthened <i>tail</i> of many ponderous joints; and one
accident, very singular, if true, occurred lately.&nbsp; A
certain luckless individual of the pig family, having too far
indulged an imprudent spirit of investigation on the Bilston
portion of the line, had his curly conclusion very summarily
amputated by a passing train:&mdash;he turned round briskly to
ascertain the extent of his calamity, when another <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>train,
whirling along in an opposite direction, coming in contact with
his head, put a period to the enterprising animal&rsquo;s
existence by an instant decapitation.&nbsp; We might draw a wise
and serious moral from this &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; event, but the
fact presents a sufficient warning to all persons inclined to
incur the penalty of two pounds in sterling coin, and limbs <i>ad
libitum</i>, for the sake of a promenade on the forbidden
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Digression is a sin,&rdquo;&mdash;on the
defunct pig&rsquo;s head be ours!&nbsp; But for his tragic
history, we should, ere this, have introduced the hill of these
parts, Barr Beacon, to our readers; it appears to the N.E.,
crowned with a dense grove of trees.&nbsp; The intervening
scenery is cheerful and cultivated, but not picturesque.&nbsp;
The village of Witton shortly appears to the E., with Barr lying
on the N.E.&nbsp; The bridge here passed is on the boundary of
Warwickshire and Staffordshire, which latter county the line now
enters.&nbsp; Aston Hall and Church again come in sight beyond
Witton, and form a beautiful rear view, which is soon shut out by
the banks of the excavation, precluding all prospect save of
their own sloping sides, the pebbles and markings in which are
made, by the rapidity of passing, to appear like flying
lines.</p>

distance on the W.,) another town in the iron and coal district,
and, according to tradition, the seat of Wulphere, king of
Mercia, who put his two sons to death for embracing
Christianity.&nbsp; On the hill at Berry Bank, are the remains of
a large castle and entrenchments, and near by, a Barrow, which it
were heresy to doubt were the residence and grave of this
redoubtable personage.&nbsp; The chief manufactures of this, as
of the neighbouring towns, consist of various iron and steel
goods.&nbsp; The whole district is abundantly traversed by
canals, tram-roads, &amp;c., for the convenient conveyance of
merchandise, and presents to the passing traveller less subject
for praise in point of beauty, than for admiration and surprise,
at the closely-placed engines, mills, coal-pits, iron-mines, and
factories, which greet him on all sides, with hissing, curling
volumes of white steam, or thick massy clouds of rolling
smoke.&nbsp; Should the traveller journey through this strange
neighbourhood by night, the novel and wild, not to say, grand,
effect of the fires, must strike him forcibly.&nbsp; Huge
furnaces glowing on the earth, from a dark wayside forge; tall
chimneys, themselves not seen in the gloom, vomiting forth flames
and fiery-coloured smoke, or a long range of glowing hillocks,
where flickering <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

these, the dusky figures of the men and boys employed in the

grotesque.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the distance, S.W. of the line, appear the Rowley Hills, a
ridge of trap or basaltic rock, which, at the time of its
elevation, upheaved and broke through the coal strata.&nbsp; The
stone being hard and compact, the hills are quarried for paving
flags, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The principal mass of these (trap rocks)
occurs in the southern part of the county, overlying the
coal-field which surrounds the town of Dudley.&nbsp; It there
constitutes the material of a group of hills, beginning on the S.
of that town, and terminating about half-way between Halesowen
and Oldbury, a little beyond the village of Rowley.&nbsp; These
hills consist of very pure basalt, which in the neighbourhood of
Birmingham is called Rowley rag, because the village of Rowley is
situated on one of these basalt hills; and this hill appears to
the eye to be the highest of the whole range.&nbsp; These hills
are all covered with soil; but quarries have been opened in many
of them, and the basalt of which they are composed is employed
for mending the roads.&nbsp; The streets of Birmingham are
likewise paved with it.&nbsp; The columnar structure, though very
frequent, is far from universal in this trap, which very commonly
occurs in large spherical masses, decomposing on the surface into
concentric layers.&nbsp; An amygdaloidal variety containing
calcareous spar and zeolite occurs S. of Dudley.&nbsp; The
highest point of the Rowley Hills is stated by Dr. Thompson to be
900 feet above the Thames at Brentford.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> panting and smoking engine,
like a huge beast, rushing along with fiery jaws, and &ldquo;such
a length of tail behind,&rdquo; might, in a dark night, be easily
suspected of being &ldquo;no canny.&rdquo;&nbsp; Divers kinds of
vehicles, from post-chaises and landaus, to caravans and
<i>omnibii</i> (as a refined friend of ours pluralizes these
universal <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>conveyances) are in attendance at this station, to
convey passengers to the town of Wolverhampton, one mile distant,
or to their future destination.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wolverhampton</span> is a
place of considerable antiquity, and was called Hanton or Hampton
prior to the year 996, when Wulfrana, sister of King Edgar, and
widow of Aldhelm, Duke of Northampton, founded a college here,
endowing it with so many privileges that the town was called in
her honour, <i>Wulfranis Hampton</i>, of which its present name
is evidently a corruption.&nbsp; The College continued till the
year 1200, when Petrus Blesensis, who was then dean, after
fruitless attempts to reform the dissolute lives of the brethren,
surrendered the establishment to Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, and it was subsequently annexed to the deanery of
Windsor.&nbsp; In 1590, the greater part of the town was
destroyed by a fire, which continued burning for five days.&nbsp;
In the parliamentary war, Wolverhampton aided the royalists, and
Prince Rupert fixed his head-quarters here, while the king was
encamped at Bushbury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The town is situated on an eminence, on the N.W. side of the
great midland coal-district, and the neighbourhood abounds with
iron, coal, and limestone.&nbsp; The manufacture of locks, forms
here as in the other towns in the vicinity, the staple trade, to
which may be added, smith&rsquo;s and carpenter&rsquo;s tools,
machinery of all kinds, furnishing ironmongery, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
modern streets are well-built and lighted, and contain many
handsome and substantial houses.&nbsp; A public Subscription
Library and News-room, occupy the lower part of a commodious
building, in which, assemblies and concerts are likewise
held.&nbsp; A Literary and Philosophical Society is established,
but not yet supported in a manner at all proportioned to its
merits; a circumstance not reflecting much honour on the
professedly intelligent <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and &ldquo;higher&rdquo; classes of
the inhabitants.&nbsp; The Mechanics&rsquo; Institution is in a
more flourishing condition, for obvious reasons, being patronized
by the more knowledge-loving part of the community.&nbsp; The
Theatre is opened occasionally; it is a small and unpretending
structure.&nbsp; Races are annually held in August, in an
extensive area near the town, and are well attended.&nbsp; In the
centre of the market-place stands a cast-iron column, forty-five
feet high, surmounted by a large gas lantern, which was intended
by its sanguine projector to enlighten the whole town and
suburbs, but, alas for the great designs of short-sighted
humanity!&mdash;its sphere of usefulness is unfortunately
restricted to the attic and chamber windows of the houses
immediately contiguous.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Collegiate Church is an ancient and exceedingly beautiful
cruciform structure, in the early decorated style of
architecture, with a handsome square embattled tower rising from
the centre.&nbsp; It contains a curious and elaborately-carved
stone pulpit, formed of one entire block, an ancient font, and
several interesting monuments.&nbsp; In the church-yard is a
column, twenty feet high, greatly enriched with sculpture of
various designs, supposed to be of either Saxon or Danish
origin.&nbsp; There are several other churches in Wolverhampton,
and many religious establishments belonging to various sects of
dissenters; also a Free Grammar School, Blue Coat Charity,
National, Sunday, and other Schools.&nbsp; The population of
Wolverhampton is about 25,000; it has a market on Wednesday, and
a fair on July 10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> quitting the station at
Wolverhampton a good view is obtained of the town and fine old
Church, with the hills of Rowley Regis in the distance.&nbsp;
Tettenhall Wood and the Clee Hills soon add to the beauty of the
southward view; and the line is skirted by fine trees and fresh
verdant meadows, over which a peep of the distant landscape is
gained at intervals.&nbsp; Show Hill, and Low Hill houses are
pleasantly situated on the ridge of a hill to the E., and beyond
them appears Bushbury Hill, a point of the same elevation, with
its old village <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Church, built about 1460; this is perhaps the most
pleasing part of the line we have yet traversed.&nbsp; The Wrekin
appears in the distance to the W., and nearer, the lofty and
tapering spire of Brewood (or Brood) Church, rises from its
girdling woods.&nbsp; Moseley Court, the ancient seat of J. G.
Whitgreave, Esq., lies E. of the line, whence but little of the
house is visible, being surrounded by stately oak groves.&nbsp;
In this venerable mansion, Charles II. was temporarily concealed,
when on his way to Bentley.&nbsp; Wrottesley Park, seat of Sir
John Wrottesley, Bart., Chillington Park and Hall, the noble
residence of T. W. Giffard, Esq., and the village of Codsall,
form portions of the scenery to the S.W.&nbsp; All this part of
the line from Wolverhampton is on an embankment, which, however,
does not exceed fifteen feet at the highest point.&nbsp; On the
E. appears Hilton Park, seat of H. E. C. V. Graham, Esq., and on
the W., Pendeford Hall.&nbsp; The villages of Shareshill and
Featherstone, lie E. of the line.&nbsp; A bridge here crosses it,
bearing the felicitous name of &ldquo;Paradise;&rdquo; happy
mortals, to reach such blessed bourne!&nbsp; But our stay is
brief indeed; Paradise is left far behind, and we pass onwards
under and over many a bridge of great and small degree; for the
railroad even renders a common dirty gutter, a thing of so great
importance, that a stately and ponderous arch must be erected for
its insignificant accommodation!&nbsp; Verily, we grow
aristocratic in our indignation at such upstart doings.&nbsp; The
honourable fraternity of Ditch, Gutter, and Co., may, with a good
grace, quote the old fable, and exclaim, &ldquo;How we apples
swim;&rdquo; they are marvellously promoted since &ldquo;an
hundred years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page28"></a><span

the railroad over, a handsome iron bridge, between the village of

<p>The wide moorland called Cannock Chase, lies E., and is for
some distance seen from the line.&nbsp; It was in earlier times,
a forest or chase belonging to the Mercian kings.&nbsp; In one
part, Castle Hill, now enclosed by the boundary of Beaudesert
Park, seat of the Marquis of Anglesea, is an ancient British
encampment, surrounded by a double trench, occupying about
fourteen acres.&nbsp; Near it are the remains of a moat,
enclosing an oblong square of three acres, called the Old
Nunnery, where a Cistercian Abbey was founded in the reign of
Stephen, which was shortly after removed to Stoneleigh, in
Warwickshire.&nbsp; Cannock Chase, or Heath, contains upwards of
25,000 acres; in some parts, containing extensive sheep
walks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> the railroad crosses the old
Roman road called Watling-street; the ancient pr&aelig;torian
highway, reaching from Dover, by St. Albans, Dunstable,
Towcester, Atherstone, Shrewsbury, &amp;c., to Cardigan; in many
places it is scarcely perceptible, while in others it continues
firm for several miles.&nbsp; And who can pass such a junction of
roads, without a backward glance at past years and events?
without a thought of the thousand &ldquo;changes of time and
tide&rdquo; that this ancient track has witnessed: the millions
of human footsteps it has received:&mdash;the proud and
victorious Roman, exulting in his country&rsquo;s greatness and
conquests, and contemptuously spurning the savage natives, whose
natural rights he invaded:&mdash;the rapacious and desolating
Dane:&mdash;the wily Saxon:&mdash;the adventurous Norman: and now
the compound people, we English, who, not content with the ways
of our fathers, must needs cross them with our refined and
scientific innovations.&nbsp; In sooth, this ancient road were a
fitter subject for an epic poem, than a guide-book gossip.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Stafford</span> is a borough
and market town; contains 8,512 inhabitants.&nbsp; This place,
which is of great antiquity, was anciently called
<i>Stadeford</i>, from the Saxon Stade, signifying a place on a
river, and the <i>trajectus</i>, or ford, across the river Sow,
on which it is pleasantly situated, about six miles from its
confluence with the Trent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entrance from the London road, is by a neat bridge over
the river, near which was one of the ancient gates.&nbsp; The
houses are in general well-built, and many of them are handsome
and modern erections; the streets well paved, and the environs of
the town abound with elegant mansions and villas.&nbsp;
Assemblies are held in a suite of rooms in the Town Hall, and
races take place annually in May.&nbsp; The chief branch of
manufacture is that of shoes, and the tanning of leather is
carried on to a considerable extent.&nbsp; Stafford is also
renowned for its ale, in common with the surrounding
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The market is held on Saturday, and fairs on
April 5, May 14, June 25, October 3, and December 5.</p>

<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>From
the year 700, this place has been gradually acquiring importance,
and castles have been built and rebuilt by successive princes and
possessors.&nbsp; In 705, it is said to have been the residence
of the pious St. Bertalin, son of a Mercian king, and we may well
imagine a <i>royal</i> hermitage to have formed an attractive
nucleus for a future city.&nbsp; Ethelfleda, Countess of Mercia,
erected a castle here in 913, and fortified the town with walls
and a fosse.&nbsp; It appears to have increased greatly in extent
and importance, and is in Doomsday Book called a city, in which
the king had eighteen burgesses in demesne, and the Earl of
Mercia twenty mansions.&nbsp; William the Conqueror built a
castle here, to keep the barons in subjection, and appointed as
governor, Robert de Toeni, the progenitor of the house of
Stafford.&nbsp; It was rebuilt in the reign of Edward III., and
in the parliamentary war was garrisoned for the king, but taken
by the parliamentary troops, and finally demolished.&nbsp; The
lover of picturesque relics of the olden time, must regret the
utter destruction of this, and many other strong holds; but the
knowledge, that the iron-handed tyranny upheld by these feudal
dens, is for ever gone by with their departed strength, is a
glorious and surpassing compensation.&nbsp; Where would be our
railroads, if moss-trooping barons and slavish serfs formed, as
they once did, the population of England?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The castellated building which now forms so prominent a
feature in the landscape on approaching Stafford, is a modern
erection, on the ancient site, commenced by Lord Stafford, (then
Sir George Jerningham); <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>only one front, flanked by two round
towers was completed; these now contain some ancient armour and
other curiosities.&nbsp; The County Hall is a spacious and
handsome building of stone, occupying one side of the
Market-place.&nbsp; The County Gaol is also a large and modern
erection, well adapted for the classification of prisoners, who
are employed at their trades, and receive a certain portion of
their earnings on discharge.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Mary, formerly collegiate, is an
ancient and spacious cruciform structure, in the early style of
English architecture, with a lofty octagonal tower rising from
the intersection.&nbsp; The north entrance is richly ornamented,
and the interior beautifully arranged, the piers and arches are
of the early English, passing into the decorated style.&nbsp; The
east window is an elegant specimen of the later English.&nbsp; In
the north transept is an ancient font of great beauty, highly
ornamented with sculptured figures and animals.&nbsp; There are
many ancient monuments; amongst the most conspicuous, are those
of the family of Aston, of Tixall.&nbsp; There are two other
Churches, one, St. Chadd&rsquo;s, originally in the Norman style,
but much and incongruously altered; also, places of worship for
the Society of Friends, Independents, Wesleyan Methodists, and
Roman Catholics.&nbsp; The Free Grammar School was refounded by
Edward VI.; there are also National and other Schools, and a
variety of Public Institutions, among which the Infirmary, and
Lunatic Asylum are the chief.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In olden times, a Priory of Black Canons existed <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>here, founded
in 1151; a small part of whose ruined abode remains, in the shape
of a farm house, two miles east of the town.&nbsp; There were
likewise, a House of Friars Eremites; a Priory of Franciscan
Friars, and other monastic establishments, all dismantled at the
dissolution.&nbsp; The most celebrated native of Stafford, is
Isaac Walton, the angler, a name well-beloved by all votaries of
the (so called) &ldquo;<i>gentle</i> sport,&rdquo; though there
are and have been many who rather think with the Poet, that</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> leaving Stafford station, the
Castle appears to the W. and the Town, E. of the line.&nbsp;
Beacon Hill is seen immediately over the latter.&nbsp; On
proceeding a short distance through a flat country, the little
village of Aston is passed on the W., and Creswell Hall, (Rev. T.
Whitley,) on the E., which, encompassed by richly wooded grounds,
and overlooking the meanderings of the little river Sow, forms a
fine object in the general landscape.&nbsp; The house is a plain,
neat structure.&nbsp; Much of the ground here is marshy, and
abounds with willows, whose light silvery foliage agreeably
diversifies the meadow and woodland scenery; amid which, on the
W., peeps the pretty tower of Seighford Church.</p>

<p>A picturesque Mill stands near the Hall.&nbsp; Passing Chebsey

scattered cottages represent the honours of the Village, and the
Sow, which almost emulates the winding propensities of the fair
river Wye, meanders quietly among the meadows.&nbsp; At
Shallowford Bridge, which is chiefly built for the convenience of

38</span><span class="smcap">Two</span> miles and a half W. of
this station lies the small town of Eccleshall, which at the time
of the Conquest belonged to the See of Lichfield.&nbsp; In 1200,
Bishop Muschamp obtained a licence from King John, to embattle
the episcopal residence; which was much repaired, or rebuilt, by
Bishop Langton in 1310.&nbsp; During the parliamentary war it was
so much damaged in a siege, previously to being taken by the
parliamentarians, as to be unfit for the further residence of the
church-militant commanders-in-chief, until Bishop Lloyd rebuilt
it in 1695; since which time it has continued to be the episcopal
palace of the See of Lichfield and Coventry.&nbsp; The grounds
and woods belonging to the palace are pleasant and
extensive.&nbsp; The church was the sanctuary of Queen Margaret,
after Lord Audley&rsquo;s defeat by the Earl of Salisbury, at
Blore Heath.&nbsp; It is a spacious structure, in the ancient
English style of architecture, and contains several
monuments.</p>
<p>The town of Stone lies three miles E. of the line, and is not
seen from it; the name is traditionally derived from a monumental
heap of stones, which, according to the custom of the Saxons had
been placed over the bodies of the princes Wulford and Rufinus,
who were here slain by their father king Wulphere, on account of
their conversion to Christianity.&nbsp; [<i>See page</i> 20.] The
king himself becoming subsequently a convert, founded, in 670, a
college of Secular Canons, dedicating it to his children, in
expiation of his crime: and to this establishment the town is
supposed to owe its origin.&nbsp; The prevailing manufacture is
that of shoes.&nbsp; Population, 7,808.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although none of the towns in the great district called the
Potteries, are upon or even seen from the line of route, yet they
lie so near, that it would scarcely be well to omit all mention
of this great manufacturing neighbourhood, which encloses about
ten square miles of country, covered with scattered villages, and
containing about 20,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; Although the making of
articles of pottery has been carried on here from a remote
period, yet the manufacture was of inferior <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>importance,
until the great improvements effected by Mr. Wedgewood in the
latter part of the last century; since which time the excellence
and beauty of the wares, have produced a most extensive traffic
both in England and abroad.&nbsp; The exports of earthenware and
china to the United States alone, amount to 60,000 packages
annually.&nbsp; The several species of ware invented by Mr.
Wedgewood, varied by the industry and ingenuity of the
manufacturers into an infinity of forms, and differently painted
and embellished, constitute nearly the whole of the fine
earthenwares at present manufactured in England, which are the
object of a very extensive trade.&nbsp; The chief towns and
villages in the Pottery district are, Stoke-upon-Trent, Hanley,
Burslem, Lane End, Shelton, Etruria, Tunstall, Lane Delph, and
others.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Proceeding from Norton Bridge, through some pretty,
common-place country, we pass Baddenhall, Field Cross, and
Brockton-house on the W., and Coldmese on the E., and soon gain a
view of Swinnerton Park and Hall, seat of T. Fitzherbert, Esq.,
which, with the small grove-like woods scattered through the
landscape, forms, as the quaint Dugdale would say, &ldquo;a verye
faire prospect.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next small representation of a
village is Mill Meese, with its old Hall standing close beside
the line; the water-mill wheel, formerly accustomed to have no
rival sound interrupt its rumbling, splashing solo, now seems
wofully outdone by the rapidly rolling trains, and lifts up its
unheard voice in vain.&nbsp; The river Sow still flows close to
the line.&nbsp; Westward lie the villages of Walford and Aspley,
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>but too
much concealed by wood to be discovered in passing.&nbsp;
Trentham Park, seat of the Marquis of Sutherland, is perceived on
the N.E.&nbsp; The mansion is a modern structure; the surrounding
grounds are very extensive, abound with fine timber, and greatly
adorned by lakes, formed by the river Trent, which flows through
the park.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Standon Church, with the richly wooded country round, forms a
pleasing object W. of the line.</p>

being two of that name.&nbsp; Hill Chorlton and Chapel Chorlton,
with the picturesque church tower of the latter, appears W. of
the traveller.&nbsp; A short distance of pretty wooded scenery
intervenes, and then <a name="page41"></a><span

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> extensive heathy bog is
traversed by the line, after leaving Whitmore station, and, as we
have heard an ancient tradition anent it, will tell the tale for
the edification of our readers, &ldquo;extenuating
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was a large forest in this
part, and when the Romans were amusing themselves with hunting
our worthy ancestors, a large body of the ancient Britons took
refuge therein.&nbsp; In order to come at them these terrible
Romans set fire to the forest, which burnt in a very fearful and
dreadful manner; but our information does not extend to the exact
measure of scorching endured by the miserable prisoners within
this fiery fence, or whether they escaped by flight, or were
consumed wholesale in the burning forest, which, with the
accumulation of vegetable matter during past ages, has formed the
bog, now &ldquo;passed with the swiftness of
tornado-blast,&rdquo; by &ldquo;Wildfires&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rockets.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposite the Bog-house is one of the highest points of the
line, the road inclining towards Liverpool one way, and towards
Birmingham the other.&nbsp; Snape Hall is prettily situated among
rich woods on the E. of the line; and a short distance farther
Barr Hill appears on the W.&nbsp; It is a considerable elevation,
and on a clear day, Liverpool may be seen from it.&nbsp; Madeley
Parks <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and
Manor House lie W. of the line.&nbsp; The latter is the seat of
Lady Cunliffe, daughter of Lord Crewe, to whose family, the
adjoining land, formerly a fine deer park, anciently
belonged.&nbsp; Hay House, a small, old, brick building, stands
close to the line of railway on the E.&nbsp; One cannot help
feeling an odd sort of commiseration for these ancient abodes of
the last generation, which have stood, and grown old and grey, in
the once quiet and out-of-the-world nooks where the convenience
of the farmer, or the retired taste of the small country squire,
had located them; and now, to see the iron ribs of the innovating
railroad carried up to their very threshold, has something of
sadness in it, even in the midst of our modern pride and
gratulation.&nbsp; It is like pert youth, exhibiting and vaunting
of its strength and valorous deeds, to decrepid and helpless
age.&nbsp; But what have we to do with such dreams?&nbsp;

interesting structure, with a fine set of bells.&nbsp; An
eccentric, named Samuel Stretch, noted for his penurious habits,
bequeathed, in 1804, a great bell, to be tolled every night at
eight o&rsquo;clock, as a guide to persons wandering about at
such late and improper hours; he having accidently fallen into a
ditch, the consequences of which disaster eventually caused his
death.&nbsp; The small town of Woore lies three miles W.&nbsp;
Passing several slight cuttings, and again gaining the open
country, a fine prospect appears, including Checkley Wood,
Doddington Park, on the W., Heighley Castle on the E., and the
Welsh Hills in the distance.&nbsp; Doddington Hall, seat of
Lieut. Gen. Sir John Delves Broughton, Bart., is a splendid
mansion of comparatively modern erection.&nbsp; A fortified house
was erected here in 1364, by Sir John Delves, the venerable ruins
of which still remain.&nbsp; The park is finely wooded, and
includes a very noble avenue of ancient oaks.&nbsp; Heighley
Castle partakes the traditionary honour so lavishly bestowed on
such places, of having been &ldquo;battered down&rdquo; by
Cromwell.&nbsp; It has been said, &ldquo;no man can be in two
places at once, unless he be a <i>bird</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And our
renowned Oliver must needs have been wonderfully endowed with
this ornithological ubiquity, if we are to allow a shade of

two viaducts carry the line through the pretty valley of
Wrinehill; the Hall and Mill forming very pleasing objects in the

distance, join in the landscape for some space.&nbsp; Chorlton is
the first village we pass in Cheshire, and Wybunbury, a place of
much more importance, is concealed by the woods about the former,
except the Church, which peers above them.&nbsp; This Church was
rebuilt in 1595; it is a spacious structure, with carved wooden
ceilings, and a lofty pinnacled tower, which leaned so much to
the N.E., that a few years since it was found requisite to place
it erect, when some alterations were made in the body of the
Church.&nbsp; To the W. is Basford Hall, soon after passing

contains 5,350 inhabitants, and has a market on Saturdays, and
fairs, chiefly for cattle, on March 26, second Tuesday in June,
September 4, and December 4.</p>
<blockquote><p>Previously to the Conquest, the wealth of this
place consisted in its numerous brine springs.&nbsp; Its origin
is attributed to the Britons; and its name appears to be derived
from the British word <i>Nant</i>, a brook or marsh, and the
Saxon <i>vic</i>, by corruption <i>wich</i>, a vill, or
settlement.&nbsp; The latter term seems generally attached to the
names of towns where salt is made.&nbsp; This town has had its
full share of plague, pestilence, and war, in times past, and
twice suffered greatly from fire, in the years 1438 and
1583.&nbsp; During the civil war it staunchly supported the
parliament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The town is situated on the banks of the river Weaver, in a
level and fertile tract of country.&nbsp; Most of the houses are
of timber and brick, covered with plaster, with projecting
stories, and large bay-windows.&nbsp; There is a small Theatre
and Assembly-room.&nbsp; In the time of Henry VIII., there were
three hundred salt <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>works; this number has been gradually reduced, in
consequence of superior mines and springs being discovered
elsewhere, and now only one spring remains.&nbsp; Shoes, gloves,
and cotton goods are the chief manufactures now, and cheese the
principal agricultural produce.&nbsp; The Church is a spacious
and venerable structure, in the decorated and later English
styles, comprising a nave, with lateral aisles, a chancel,
transepts, and an ornamented octagonal tower, rising from the
intersection.&nbsp; There are Meetings and Chapels for
Dissenters, and various Schools.&nbsp; John Gerarde, whose fine
old work, called Gerarde&rsquo;s Herbal, is familiar to every
botanist, was a native of Nantwich, born in 1545.</p>

Manchester on one side, and to Chester on the other.&nbsp; The

becomes flat, boggy, and uninteresting; for though an ancient
moss is a scene of uncloying interest to a naturalist, and
contains many a treasure to reward the patient seeking of the
botanist; yet, in the cursory glance of a railroad traveller, its
sombre, and, as he perhaps thinks, unprofitable waste, is a scene
gladly exchanged for verdant pastures and waving corn
fields.&nbsp; Here is a whole family of mosses, all lying closely
contiguous, and quaking under the foot of the pedestrian wanderer

<blockquote><p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Beeston Castle was founded by Ranulph de Blundeville,
about 1220, and was made a royal garrison, in the war between
Henry III., and the confederate Barons.&nbsp; In 1643, Beeston
Castle was held by a detachment of the Parliamentarian forces,
then taken by the Royalists, who were, after a long siege in
1645, compelled, from want of provisions, to surrender it; and
the Parliamentarians dismantled it early the following
year.&nbsp; The ruins consist of part of a tower which guarded
the principal entrance to the inner court, flanked by
semi-circular bastions, and surrounded by a moat, excavated in
the solid rock.&nbsp; The outer walls were defended by eight
round towers, irregularly placed, and are now covered with
ivy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the N.W. appears Delamere Forest, which continues to form
part of the railroad prospect for some space.&nbsp; This tract,
which includes the ancient and royal forest of Delamere, was
uninclosed till 1812, when it was erected into a parish by act of
parliament.&nbsp; It was formerly a dreary waste, but is now
rapidly improving in fertility and increased population.&nbsp; On
its enclosure, it first gave the title of Baron Delamere of Vale
Royal, to Thomas Cholmondeley, Esq., the proprietor of the
ancient possessions of the Cistercian monks of Vale Royal, whose
sumptuous Abbey was completed in 1330, by Edward I., and cost
&pound;32,000.&nbsp; There are races in March, called the
Tanfield Hunt.</p>
<blockquote><p>Delamere Forest, comprising about 10,000 acres,
once contained a great number of red and fallow deer: it exhibits
a pleasing variety of well-wooded hills, rich valleys for
pasturage, waters affording plenty of fish and water-fowl; and
mosses, producing an abundance of peat and turf for fuel.&nbsp;
Upon the highest hill stood the Saxon fortress of Finborrow, and
near it the city of Eadesbury, both of which are said to have
been founded by Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the Great.&nbsp;
The ancient residence of the Chief Forester is all that now
remains; this house is called the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Chamber of the Forest; and at
convenient distances around it are neat lodges for the keepers of
the several walks.&nbsp; Five thousand acres of the forest have
been planted with forest trees within the last twenty
years.&nbsp; The remaining portion is sold or allotted to private
individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Journeying on, we pass Lea Hall, a plain, old-fashioned
building, close to the line, and can just perceive Over Church
above the trees; this part of the line being more clothed with
wood than that we have recently described.&nbsp; Here the
Middlewich Canal is crossed, and is seen on the E., in which
direction, two miles from the line, lies the town of Middlewich,
containing about 4,800 inhabitants, with a market on Thursday,
and fairs on Holy Thursday, Aug. 25, and Oct. 29.&nbsp; The name
of this town is derived from its central situation with respect
to the Wiches, or Salt Towns.&nbsp; A Roman station is supposed
to have existed here, from the remains of a Roman road, and an
intrenched camp.&nbsp; The Royalists were defeated here during
the civil war, and the same fortune befel the Parliamentarian
forces subsequently.&nbsp; The town is divided by the Grand Trunk
Canal, here crossed by the river Dane; and the rivers Weyer,
Croco, and Whelock, also run through the parish.&nbsp; The chief
trade consists in salt obtained from powerful brine-springs:
there are also some silk manufactories.&nbsp; The church, being
built at various periods, presents an assemblage of different
styles of architecture: it has a handsome tower.&nbsp; Here are
also dissenting meetings, and a free school, which, like many
like establishments, fulfils, but in a very limited degree, the
intentions of its founders.&nbsp; Delamere Forest and Over Church
again form the westerly view.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
small straggling town of Over lies about a mile W. of the line;
it contains 2,930 inhabitants; has no market, but fairs on May 15
and Sept.&nbsp; 25.&nbsp; The church was re-built in 1543, by
Hugh Starkey, Gentleman Usher to Henry VIII., in the later
English style of architecture.&nbsp; An effigy of brass in the
interior of the church, perpetuates the memory of the pious Hugh;
a curious font, and some other antiquities, may also be
seen.&nbsp; Salt is the chief manufacture.&nbsp; In the extreme

stone, and is a noble erection.&nbsp; The traveller will do well
to be alert and on the &ldquo;look out&rdquo; in this part, or
the view will escape him.&nbsp; Westward lies Vale Royal Park,
rich in the grandeur of its ancient woods, and nearly hidden
among them is Delamere Abbey, the old and venerable seat of Lord
Delamere.&nbsp; Little remains now of the ancient building, which
was not, as described by Warton in his Elegy, seen &ldquo;high

HARTFORD TO WARRINGTON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">Twelve and &frac14; Miles.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Proceeding</span> from the Hartford
station, the banks of the cutting conceal much of the
scenery.&nbsp; The small and scattered village of Gorstage
appears on the W.&nbsp; From Hartford station to Acton station
the evenness of the ground renders a train visible to a
spectator, at either place, the entire distance.</p>
<blockquote><p>The town of Northwich lies two miles E. of the
railway; has a market on Friday, and fairs on April 10, for
cattle only, August 2, and December 6.&nbsp; Camden is of
opinion, that the brine springs here were used by the Romans, and
says, the town was anciently called Hellah-Du, or the Black Salt
Town.&nbsp; The town has a very antique appearance, and contains
a church very remarkable for its semi-circular choir, and for the
curious decorations of the roof of the nave, which consist of
numerous figures of wicker baskets, similar to those used in the
process of salt-making.&nbsp; The commercial prosperity of
Northwich, is entirely dependent upon its numerous brine springs
and extensive mines of rock salt; in which article the trade is
so great, as to produce an annual export of 100,000 tons from the
springs alone.&nbsp; They were discovered at a very early period,
and are usually more than one hundred yards in depth.&nbsp; The
brine, being raised by pumps set in motion by steam-engines, is
conveyed by pipes into pans, thirty or forty feet square: these
are fixed over furnaces, the heat arising from which, causes the
water to evaporate, and the salt to crystallise; it is then <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>drained and
dried, and is fit for sale.&nbsp; The mines of rock salt were
discovered in 1670, the upper stratum, lying about sixty yards
below the surface of the earth, is ten yards thick.&nbsp; About
1772, a second stratum, ten feet thick, and of superior quality,
was discovered, at the depth of one hundred and ten yards, the
intermediate space being occupied by a solid mass of stone.&nbsp;
This latter bed alone is worked by the following process:&mdash;A
shaft is sunk, and on reaching the mine a roof of salt is left,
supported by pillars of the same material.&nbsp; As the
excavation proceeds, the fragments are raised in buckets by means
of steam-engines.&nbsp; The pits form an area of two, three, or
four acres, and when illuminated, present a singularly beautiful
and magnificent appearance; the light being reflected from all
points in every variety of hue, as from a promiscuous assemblage
of mirrors and prisms.&nbsp; This fairy palace was the scene of
an elegant entertainment, given by the spirited proprietors, to
about a hundred of the members of the British Association, during
the meeting at Liverpool, in 1837.</p>
<p>From an account published in 1818, it appeared that 200,000
tons of manufactured salt, and upwards of 40,000 tons of rock
salt, were landed at Liverpool during the preceding year, and
that upwards of 280,000 bushels are annually sold for internal
consumption, by far the greatest proportion having been obtained
in this neighbourhood; since that period the business has
materially increased.&nbsp; The river Weaver and the Grand Trunk
Canal afford great facilities for water-carriage from Northwich;
and three hundred vessels are employed in the salt trade alone,
which return laden with coal.</p>

<p>Passing through one or two slight cuttings, the line commands
a fine view of Grange Hall, which stands on a well-wooded hill,

Weaverham, and Winnington Hall, and, in the distance, the Overton

Dutton.</p>
<blockquote><p>This gigantic structure exceeds in magnitude
anything of the kind yet accomplished in this country, or perhaps
in Europe, not even excepting the Menai Bridge.&nbsp; The Viaduct
is of the Gothic order, formed of red sand-stone procured from
the neighbourhood of Bolton and Runcorn; it consists of twenty
arches, of sixty feet span, and sixty feet in height, and the
battlements add twelve feet more to the height; the whole length
is 1,400 feet: 700,000 cubic feet of stone have been used in the
work&mdash;the whole cost was &pound;50,000.</p>

the richness and beauty of the adjacent country.</p>

Weaver, at Dutton.&nbsp; A party of the directors from Liverpool
attended, and were met by Mr. Locke, the engineer, and the
resident engineers and contractors on the line.&nbsp; Mr.
Heyworth, as the senior director present, after placing the last
stone in its bed, addressed the party.&nbsp; He congratulated the
workmen (of whom about one hundred and fifty were present) on
their steady perseverance and diligence in bringing to perfection
so noble a work: he rejoiced to find, that, in the erection of
this, the greatest and first structure of its kind in the
kingdom, no life or limb had been sacrificed.&nbsp; Mr. Locke,
the engineer, and the Rev. W. Stanhope, also addressed the
meeting.&nbsp; The health of the workmen was then given by Mr.
Locke, amid hearty cheers.&nbsp; In the evening, the viaduct was
illuminated with torches, and fireworks were displayed in great
abundance; during which time the workmen were regaled with a good
dinner and excellent cheer.&mdash;<i>Chester Courant</i>.</p>

<p>The traveller who would enjoy glimpses of railroad views, must
bear in mind the velocity of his conveyance, and prepare to
&ldquo;see whatever can be seen,&rdquo; or the most important
objects will have glanced by the windows of his comfortable
locomotive arm-chair coach, before any second person can warn him
of their presence.&nbsp; Emerging from a cutting, which
immediately succeeds the viaduct, Dutton Hall is observed on the
E. backed by wood.&nbsp; A short distance farther, a fine
rear-view is obtained (only by outside passengers we fear) of the
Weaver, the vale of Dutton, Cogshall Park beyond, and in the
distance the range of Derbyshire Hills.&nbsp; Passing between
Bird Wood and Dutton Wood, we reach the tunnel at Preston Brook,

writers supposed to have been originally a British town, and on
the invasion of the Romans under Agricola, in 79, to have been
converted into a Roman station.&nbsp; This supposition rests
chiefly on the circumstances of three Roman roads tending
hitherwards to a ford over the Mersey; the vestiges of a castrum
and fosse, still discernable; and the discovery of Roman coins
and other relics near the ford.&nbsp; <a name="page63"></a><span

obtained the name of <i>Weringtun</i>, from <i>W&aelig;ring</i>,
a fortification, and <i>tun</i>, a town.&nbsp; The river was
passed by ford till 1496, when Thomas, first Earl of Derby,
erected a stone bridge in compliment to Henry VII., when on his
visit to Latham and Knowsley.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII.,
Leland, speaking of Warrington, says, &ldquo;It is a pavid towne
of prety bignes, the paroche chirce is at the tayle of the towne;
it is a better market than Manchestre.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the civil
wars of 1643, the Royalists of the place betook themselves to the

long, 22 feet wide, and 16 feet high.&nbsp; Engines are stationed
on each side of the line at this part, each of forty-horse power,
to draw the trains up the inclined plane of the tunnel, in coming
out of Liverpool, and let them down on their arrival from
Birmingham.&nbsp; The locomotive engines being attached to and
detached from the trains at this station.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;A Friend to Railways,&rdquo; in a letter to the Editor
of the Railway Magazine, May 1838, thus describes the mode of
drawing the trains up the inclined plane:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the upper end of the tunnel, which is
2,250 yards long, there is one pair of engines on each side of
the road; it being found <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that a much more regular motion is
given by this means to the carriages.&nbsp; The engines are
high-pressure, with side-levers, similar to marine engines; the
connecting-rods, however, are reversed, and work the crank
downwards, and are connected to a horizontal shaft of great
strength running across and under the road in a tunnel, upon
which shaft a large drum-wheel is placed that works the
rope.&nbsp; In each engine-house is a raised platform, upon which
the man stands who works the engines; this platform leads to a
balcony on the outside of the engine-house, from which the man
can look down the mouth of the tunnel; a signal is given by means
of an air-pipe running through the tunnel, so formed at the upper
end as to produce a sound when the air is forced into it from the
lower extremity.&nbsp; This, I believe, is the invention of Mr.
King, of Liverpool.&nbsp; The engine-man on hearing the signal,
opens the steam-cock, and the engines start instantly.&nbsp; This
work was designed by Mr. Grantham, of the foundery of Messrs.
Mather and Dickson, of Liverpool, where the machinery was
constructed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having now given an account of the whole journey, we must
proceed to a brief history and memoir of Liverpool itself.</p>
<h2><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
LIVERPOOL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> is an ancient sea-port,
borough, and market town, 205 miles from London, containing
205,964 inhabitants, exclusive of 10,000 seamen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of its remote antiquity but little can be
asserted, amidst the great contrariety of opinion which is held
on this subject.&nbsp; Liverpool is not noticed in any of the
Roman Itinera, neither does the name occur in the Norman
survey.&nbsp; After the conquest it was granted by William, to
Roger de Poictiers, together with all the land between the Ribble
and the Mersey, and subsequently forfeited.&nbsp; It was
thereupon granted to the Earls of Chester; and on forfeiture by
their descendants, to Edmund, son of Henry III., as parcel of the
honour of Lancaster; and it remained an integral part of the
duchy possessions, until its alienation by Charles I., in
1628.</p>
<p>Various opinions have been hazarded regarding the etymology of
the name, without reference to the most ancient documents in
which it has been discovered.&nbsp; John, whilst Earl of Moreton,
and in possession of the honour of Lancaster, confirmed a grant
made by his father, Henry II., to Warin de Lancaster, of
<i>Liverpul</i>, with other places, under a certain
<i>reddendum</i>.&nbsp; In subsequent records it is written
<i>Lyrpul</i>, <i>Lythyrpul</i>, &amp;c., signifying, probably,
in the ancient dialect of this country, the &ldquo;lower
pool.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some deduce its etymology from a pool
frequented by an aquatic fowl, called a &ldquo;Liver,&rdquo; or
from a sea-weed of that name; others, and with much more reason,
from the ancient British word <i>Lir</i>, &ldquo;the sea,&rdquo;
and a spreading water or pool, viz., the sea pool, or sea-water
pool.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Camden
says the Castle was built by Roger de Poictiers, in 1089; it
certainly was erected at a very early period.&nbsp; In October,
1323, Edward II. dates his orders, &amp;c., from Liverpool
Castle; and in April, 1358, Henry, Duke of Lancaster, resided
there for a month.&nbsp; It was demolished by order of
Parliament, during the commonwealth, and in 1715, its site was
granted by Queen Anne, to the corporation, who built St.
George&rsquo;s Church upon it.&nbsp; On King John ascending the
throne, at his brother&rsquo;s death, he again came into
possession of the honour of Lancaster, and granted a charter to
the town of Liverpool, which Henry III., in 1229, confirmed, made
the town a free borough, instituted a guild merchant, and granted
additional privileges.&nbsp; These charters have been confirmed,
and further ones granted by succeeding sovereigns.&nbsp; The
several mandates for fitting-out and providing vessels for the
royal service, addressed by Edward II. and III., and subsequent
kings, afford proof of its then being a place of extensive trade
at this early period; and the fact of the royal order for the
prohibition of the export of grain, in the time of Richard III.,
being transmitted to Liverpool only, is also a proof of its then
being the only shipping port in the country.&nbsp; Leland, in
1558, described it thus: &ldquo;<i>Lyrpole</i>, alias
<i>Lyrpoole</i>, a pavid towne, hath but a chapel, Walton, a iiii
miles off, not far from the se, is paroche chirche.&nbsp; The
king hath a castell there, and the Earle of Darbe hath a stone
house there.&nbsp; Irisch marchants cum much thither, as to a
good haven.&nbsp; After that Mersey water cumming towards
Runcorne in Cheshire liseth among the commune people the name,
and is Lyrpole.&nbsp; At Lyrpole is smaule costume payid that
causith merchants to resorte.&nbsp; Good marchaundis at Lyrpole,
and much Irisch yarn that Manchester men do by ther.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Liverpool appears to have declined, probably from the baneful
influences of the wars of York and Lancaster, until the latter
part of the reign of Elizabeth, when, in a petition from the
inhabitants to the Queen, it is described as &ldquo;Her
Majesty&rsquo;s poor decayed town of Liverpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
poverty may be understood from the fact, that when Charles I.
levied his iniquitous and despotic tax of ship money, this town
was rated at &pound;26 only, while Bristol was rated at
&pound;1,000.&nbsp; In the civil war Liverpool was alternately
held by the Parliamentarians, taken by Prince Rupert, <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and retaken
by the Parliament.&nbsp; In the reign of William III., that
monarch, with part of his train, embarked at this port for
Ireland, previously to the battle of the Boyne; and regiments and
privateer vessels were here equipped against the Pretender and
the French.</p>
<p>Times and manners are somewhat changed here since 1617, when
one of the orders of the common-council demanded, &ldquo;that
every council-man shall come to council <i>clean-shaved</i>, and
in his long clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slander and gossip were very
severely punished by the civic dignitaries, it being a law,
&ldquo;that if any man speak ill of the mayor, he shall lose his
freedom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important feature in the history of this place, is
the extraordinary rapidity with which it has risen into a degree
of splendour and importance, without example in the history of
any commercial country.&nbsp; Among the causes which have
produced its elevation to a rank but partially inferior to the
metropolis, are, its situation on the shore of a noble river,
which expands into a wide estuary; its proximity to the Irish
coast; its central position with respect to the United Kingdom;
its intimate connexion with the principal manufacturing
districts, and with every part of the kingdom, by numerous
rivers, canals, and railroads, and the persevering industry and
enterprising spirit of its inhabitants.&nbsp; Without the
romance, we may see among them the reality of the merchant-nobles
of Genoa and Venice; and the grandeur which pervades the modern
buildings of our English port may scarcely be outvied in
stateliness, and certainly not in fitness and utility, by any
palace-city of the past.</p>
<p>As we passed along the busy quays of these crowded docks, and
thought of the wealth conveyed by the <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>winged couriers of the ocean there
congregated, the following gorgeous lines in Marlow&rsquo;s Jew
of Malta, occurred to us: perhaps the expectant owners of
argosies bound hitherward, deal not quite so largely as the
poet&rsquo;s Croesus, in jewelled treasures; but we cannot very
honestly change amethysts into tobacco, nor bags of fiery opals
into bales of cotton wool; the circumstances of the case may
therefore be allowed to vary a little, without our transposing
the terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As for those Samnites, and the men of
Uzz,<br />
That bought my Spanish oils, and wines of Greece,<br />
Here have I purst their paltry silverlings,<br />
Fie! what a trouble &rsquo;tis to count this trash!<br />
Give me the merchants of the Indian mines,<br />
That trade in metal of the purest gold;<br />
The wealthy Moor, that in the eastern rocks<br />
Without control can pick his riches up,<br />
And in his house keep pearls like pebble stones;<br />
Receive them free, and sell them by the weight:<br />
Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts,<br />
Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds,<br />
Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,<br />
And seld&rsquo; seen costly stones of so great price,<br />
As one of them, indifferently rated,<br />
And of a caract of this quality<br />
May serve, in peril of calamity<br />
To rescue great kings from captivity.<br />
This is the ware wherein consists my wealth,<br />
And thus methinks, should men of judgment frame<br />
Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade,<br />
And as their wealth increaseth, so inclose<br />
Infinite riches in a little room.<br />
But now&mdash;how stands the wind?<br />
Into what corner peers my halcyon&rsquo;s bill?<br />
Ha! to east? yes:&mdash;see how stands the vane?<br />
East and by south, why then I hope my ships<br />
I sent from Egypt, and the bordering isles,<br />
Are gotten up by Nilus&rsquo; winding banks:<br />
Mine argosies from Alexandria,<br />
Loaden with spice and silks, now under sail<br />
Are smoothly gliding down by Candy shore<br />
To Malta, through our Mediterranean sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>We
have, ere this, noted many a merchant (not of Venice) to whom we
have mentally applied Salarino&rsquo;s words to Antonio; and few
will grudge the space we here occupy, by a quotation so apt and
beautiful:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Salorino</i>.&nbsp; Your mind is tossing
on the ocean;<br />
There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br />
Like seigniors and rich burghers of the flood,<br />
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,&mdash;<br />
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br />
That curtsey to them, do them reverence,<br />
As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&mdash;My wind, cooling my broth,<br />
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br />
What harm a wind too great might do at sea.<br />
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br />
But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br />
And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,<br />
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs,<br />
To kiss her burial.&nbsp; Should I go to church,<br />
And see the holy edifice of stone,<br />
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks?<br />
Which touching but my gentle vessel&rsquo;s side,<br />
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br />
Enrobe the rolling waters with my silks,<br />
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br />
And now worth nothing.&nbsp; Shall I have the thought<br />
To think on this; and shall I lack the thought<br />
That such a thing be-chanced, would make me sad?<br />
But, tell not me; I know, Antonio<br />
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br />
<i>Antonio</i>.&nbsp; Believe me, No; I thank my fortune for
it,<br />
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br />
Nor to one place: nor is my whole estate<br />
Upon the fortune of this present year:<br />
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p>The commerce of the port may be divided into three branches:
first, the trade with Ireland, whence a variety of produce,
chiefly grain, cattle, &amp;c., is imported, the gross value of
which has amounted annually to &pound;4,497,708, exclusive of
linen and manufactured wares.&nbsp; Liverpool enjoys about
two-fifths of the Irish trade.&nbsp; The <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>chief exports
are British manufactured goods, salt, coal, and general
merchandise.&nbsp; The second principal branch of trade is that
with the United States of America, of which it engrosses more
than three-fourths of the whole commerce of the kingdom.&nbsp;
The chief import is cotton wool, and from this port Manchester
and the manufacturing districts are supplied with the raw
material.&nbsp; Tobacco is also imported to an <i>alarming</i>
extent.&nbsp; The average quantity annually introduced for the
contamination of our atmosphere, being 7,623
<i>hogsheads</i>&mdash;what a fearful store of materials for
smoking the brains, and dusting the nostrils of our
fellow-creatures!&nbsp; A great quantity of American flour is
also imported.&nbsp; The third branch of the trade is that with
the West Indies, which commenced about the middle of the
seventeenth century, and which was previously engrossed by London
and Bristol.&nbsp; Sugar, rum, and coffee, are the chief luxuries
we receive thence through the other ports.&nbsp; The trade with
the East Indies is smaller; the imports are cotton, indigo,
hides, ginger, pepper, and sugar.&nbsp; With the ports of the
Mediterranean and Levant seas, Liverpool has considerable
traffic, importing wine, fruits, lemon and lime juice, olive and
other oils, barilla, and brimstone.&nbsp; From Egypt is brought
cotton; and from the Baltic sea-ports, timber, tallow,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The gross receipts of the customs at this port
alone, exceed the sum derived from the nine other principal ports
of the three kingdoms (London excepted), viz., Bristol, Hull,
Newcastle, Leith, Glasgow, Greenock, Dublin, Belfast, and
Cork.&nbsp; Vessels from, and bound to, all parts of the globe,
are congregated here; and there is scarcely a place in the world
accessible to the British flag, to which a ready conveyance is
not afforded from this enterprising port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harbour is capacious and secure: at the entrance of the
river is the Black Rock Lighthouse, erected on a point of rock on
the western coast.&nbsp; A floating light is also placed eleven
miles seaward from the mouth of the river.</p>
<p>For the security of the shipping in the port, and for <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the greater
facility of loading and unloading merchandise, immense ranges of
docks and warehouses, extending upwards of two miles along the
eastern bank of the river, have been constructed, on a scale of
unparalleled magnificence; and forming one of those
characteristics of commercial greatness in which this town is
unrivalled.&nbsp; The docks are of three kinds:&mdash;the wet
docks, which are chiefly for ships of great burden, employed in
the foreign trade, and which float in them at all states of the
tide, the water being retained by gates; the dry docks, so called
because they are left dry when the tide is out, are chiefly
appropriated to coasting vessels; and the graving docks, which
admit or exclude the water at pleasure, are adapted to the repair
of ships, during which they are kept dry, and when completed are
floated out by admitting the tide.&nbsp; The Canning Dock is
chiefly occupied by sloops from the north coast, which import
corn, provisions, and slate, and convey back the produce of the
Mediterranean, the West Indies, Portugal, and the Baltic: it has
a quay 500 yards in length.&nbsp; The Salthouse Dock is for
vessels in the Levant, Irish, and coasting trades: the quay is
759 yards in extent.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s Dock has a quay 1001
yards in length.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Dock is appropriated to
vessels from Virginia and other parts, laden with tobacco; which
article is exclusively landed here, and occupies a range of
warehouses 575 feet in length, and 239 in depth.&nbsp; The
Queen&rsquo;s Dock, 470 yards long, with a spacious quay, is
chiefly occupied by vessels freighted with timber, and by those
employed in the Dutch and Baltic trades.&nbsp; The Brunswick Dock
is larger than any of the preceding, and receives <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>vessels laden
with timber.&nbsp; Prince&rsquo;s Dock is 500 yards in length,
with spacious quays, and along the west side is a beautiful
marine parade, 750 yards long, and eleven wide, defended by a
stone parapet wall, from which is a delightful view of the river
and the shipping: it is much frequented as a promenade.&nbsp; To
the westward of these are the Clarence Dock and Basin,
appropriated solely to the use of the steam vessels trading to
and from the port: there are several smaller docks, and
considerable additions are contemplated.&nbsp; When these are
completed, the whole range of docks will be two miles and 820
yards in length, exclusively of the openings to the several
docks: the total area of water space contained in them is upwards
of ninety statute acres, and the extent of the quays in lineal
measure is 12,511 yards, or upwards of seven miles; yet spacious
as they are, they are still considered inadequate to the
increasing commerce of the port.&nbsp; Several ranges of
commodious baths are situated in the vicinity of the docks; there
are hot, cold, floating, and medicated vapour baths.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The new Custom-house is a superb and beautiful edifice, in the
Grecian style of architecture, 454 feet in length, 224 in depth,
with three principal fronts of great magnificence.&nbsp; The
Exchange buildings, erected by the late Mr. John Forster, form
sides of a quadrangular area, in the centre of which is a
monument to the memory of Lord Nelson.&nbsp; The north front of
the Hall forms the fourth side of this square.&nbsp; This is a
stately and magnificent structure in the Grecian style, with four
elegant fronts, and contains on the ground <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>floor a
council-room, and apartments for the mayor, town clerk,
pensioners, and corporation.&nbsp; The grand staircase leads into
a spacious saloon, splendidly decorated with royal portraits by
Lawrence, Hopner, Phillips, &amp;c.&nbsp; Two spacious
ball-rooms, and two richly furnished drawing rooms, decorated
with marble pillars, chandeliers, &amp;c., are entered from the
saloon.&nbsp; A grand banquet-room, refectory, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
fitted up with great taste and splendour, are also comprised in
this grand suite of apartments.&nbsp; The Public Subscription
Libraries are numerous and well selected.&nbsp; The
Athen&aelig;um contains a news-room and an extensive
library.&nbsp; The Lyceum is a handsome edifice of the Ionic
order; contains a library, coffee-room, lecture, and
committee-rooms.&nbsp; The Union News-room, Exchange News-room,
Medical and Law Libraries, are all well supported.&nbsp; The
Royal Institution is a spacious and handsome edifice, containing
on the ground floor, lecture, reading, and school-rooms; on the
first floor, a large room for the Literary and Philosophical
Society, a library, museum, spacious exhibition rooms for the
Liverpool Academy of painting, &amp;c.&nbsp; On the roof is an
observatory, and behind are a laboratory and a theatre for
chemical and philosophical experiments.&nbsp; This institution
was formed in 1814, for the advancement of literature, science,
and the arts; and the members were incorporated by royal charter,
in 1822.&nbsp; Professors, lecturers, and masters are appointed
by the society.&nbsp; The Botanic Gardens near Edge Hill, and the
Zoological Gardens, are valuable additions to the rational and
profitable amusements of the inhabitants.&nbsp; There is a
Theatre, Amphitheatre, and Circus, the <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>former for the drama, the two latter
for equestrian performances and pantomimes.&nbsp; The Wellington
Rooms, for balls, are admirably adapted for such gay
scenes.&nbsp; The summer races in July continue four days, the
course lies five miles to the N.E. of the town.&nbsp; The grand
stand is capable of accommodating 2,000 persons.&nbsp; The
chartered market days are Wednesday and Saturday, and for corn,
Tuesday and Friday.&nbsp; The Market-houses are numerous,
handsome, and commodious.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The corporation of Liverpool have an income of above
&pound;100,000 per annum, a great portion of which is expended in
the improvement of the port and embellishment of the town.&nbsp;
The Churches of the Establishment are about twenty-four in
number, some of them of great architectural beauty.&nbsp; In
addition to the Churchyards, there are two extensive Cemeteries,
one near Edge-hill; the other occupying a large tract of ground,
excavated as a quarry for stone used in the building of the
docks, and converted into a depository for the dead, at an
expense of &pound;21,000; it is tastefully laid out, and has a
suitable chapel for the performance of the funeral service.&nbsp;
The buildings dedicated to religious purposes by the several
sects of Dissenters, are about forty in number, some of them of
considerable beauty.&nbsp; The Public Schools are very numerous,
and so well supported as to render them valuably and most
extensively useful.&nbsp; That for the indigent blind, was
established in 1791; 120 pupils now receive instruction in
various branches, and are taught spinning, basket-making, the
weaving of linen, sacking, carpeting, the making of <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>list shoes,
twine, worsted rugs, and other trades, by which they may earn a
livelihood; they are also instructed in music.&nbsp; Asylums and
Institutions, too numerous to be here enumerated; Hospitals,
Infirmaries; Societies for the assistance and relief of aged
seamen, and other humane and admirable purposes, are, by the
munificence of the inhabitants, all enabled to administer in no
small degree to the wants and misfortunes of suffering
fellow-beings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the distinguished natives of the town may be noticed
Jeremiah Horrox, the astronomer, born 1619, at Toxteth Park, near
Liverpool.&nbsp; He is supposed to have been the first person who
ever predicted or observed the transit of Venus over the
sun&rsquo;s disk.&nbsp; He died on the 3rd of January, 1641, a
few days after completing his treatise on the transit which took
place in the November preceding.&nbsp; George Stubbs, the animal
painter, born 1724.&nbsp; William Sadler, who invented the
application of copper-plate prints to the embellishment of
earthenware.&nbsp; William Roscoe, author of the lives of Lorenzo
de Medici, and of Leo X.&nbsp; He died in 1831, aged
seventy-nine, equally beloved and regretted for his excellence as
a man, and for his ability as an author.&nbsp; The Rev. William
Shepherd, author of the life of Poggio Brachiolini, &amp;c., an
elegant writer, and earnest reformer.&nbsp; Dr. Currie, the
intelligent biographer of Burns, was also a native of Liverpool,
as was the gentle-minded and truly feminine poet, Felicia
Hemans.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The manufactures of Liverpool, are chiefly such as <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>are connected
with the port and the shipping, the promotion of its commerce,
and the supply of its inhabitants.&nbsp; There are several very
large sugar refineries, extensive potteries, glass-houses,
breweries, tanneries, salt and copperas works, iron and brass
foundries, foundries for cannon, anchors, chain-cables, and steam
engine machinery, manufactories for steam-boilers, engines, also
guns, small arms, sails, cordage, watches, tobacco, snuff, and
soap.&nbsp; There are numerous mills for grinding corn, mustard,
colours, and dye-woods: the manufacture of soap exceeds that of
any place in England.&nbsp; The average number of watches made
annually, is 11,500, a number greater than any town, except
London.&nbsp; Ship-building is carried on to a great extent;
several men-of-war have been launched from the dock-yards; and in
the building of steam vessels, Liverpool takes the lead of all
other ports.&nbsp; The trade of the town is greatly facilitated
by the extensive inland navigation in every direction, by which
it is connected with the manufacturing districts and chief towns
in the kingdom.&nbsp; No less than five water conveyances fall
into the Mersey, viz., the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, Duke of
Bridgewater&rsquo;s Canal, Sankey Canal, Chester and Ellesmere
Canal, and Weaver Navigation, opening communication with
Manchester, Bolton, Hull, South Lancashire, Birmingham,
Worcestershire, South of England, and Wales.</p>

respecting inns, coach-offices, &amp;c., will be found in the

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving the Newton (or, as it is

Winwick Church, Mow Copp, and the Cheshire and Rivington hills
appear in the distance.</p>
<h3><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Park
Side Station.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> the machine and apparatus for
supplying the engines with fuel and water is well worth
observing, though with great caution, as there are five lines of
rails in this place; and the difficulty of escaping from a coming
train is no small one to a stranger, who, standing upon, or among
them, would find himself greatly bewildered in any
emergency.&nbsp; The horrible death of Mr. Huskisson, from the
injuries he received at this very spot, may be a salutary warning
to the adventurous.&nbsp; A white marble slab in the wall
commemorates the awful event, which it is useless to allude to
further, the particulars being so well known.&nbsp; The Wigan
Junction Line branches off a short distance from this
point.&nbsp; Passing a short cutting on Highfield Moor, we reach
the most considerable one on the Manchester and Liverpool line,
the Kenyon excavation, the materials taken from which contributed
mainly towards the adjacent embankments.&nbsp; The Bolton
Junction line turns N. from this part, at which is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now enter on the Brossley

agricultural skill and industry, several portions having already
been drained and successfully cultivated.</p>

<p>The road traverses this immense bog for a distance of four
miles and three quarters.&nbsp; S. of the line is a fine view of
the Cheshire and Derbyshire hills, with the village of Astley and
Tildsley Church spire.&nbsp; Rivington Pike, and the Billinge
Beacon lie on the N., and the Chat Moss all around.&nbsp; Immense
labour and perseverance were required to achieve the great work
of forming a firm and durable road over this swampy tract, which
varies in depth from ten to above thirty feet.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Several
neat habitations are now erected on the farmlands redeemed from
the swamp: of these, Barton Moss Farm is the chief.&nbsp; N. of
the Moss lies Worsley Hall, seen from the line, on an
eminence.&nbsp; Botany Bay, a place of singularly ill-omened
name, is also on the left, or N. side.&nbsp; The hills before

MANCHESTER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> town of Manchester, including
Salford, contains 270,960 inhabitants, and is distant from London
186 miles, and from Liverpool thirty-one by the railroad.</p>
<blockquote><p>The origin of this town, which is remarkable for
the extent of its trade, and the importance of its manufactures,
may be traced to remote antiquity.&nbsp; In the time of the
Druids, it was distinguished as one of the principal stations of
their priests, and celebrated for the privilege of sanctuary
attached to its altar, which, in the British language, was called
<i>Meyne</i>, signifying a stone.&nbsp; Prior to the Christian
era, it was one of the principal seats of the Brigantes, who had
a castle or stronghold, called <i>Mancenion</i>, or the place of
tents, near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell, the
site of which, still called the &ldquo;Castle Field,&rdquo; was
selected as a station by the Romans, on their conquest of this
part of Britain under Agricola, about the year 79, and called by
them <i>Mancunium</i>, whence the Saxon <i>Manceastre</i>, and
our <i>Manchester</i>.&nbsp; The Romans occupied this station
during nearly four centuries, and formed roads, branching off to
their surrounding settlements.&nbsp; Various antiquities have
been from time to time discovered in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
After the departure of the Romans, a party of Saxons took the
fort from the Britons, to whom the garrison afterwards
surrendered.&nbsp; In 620, it was captured by Edwin, King of
Northumbria.&nbsp; In 627, the inhabitants were converted to
Christianity, by Paulinus, a missionary from Gregory I.&nbsp;
Manchester having been taken by the Danes, was wrested from their
possession, about 920, by Edward the Elder, who rebuilt and
fortified the town and <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>castle.&nbsp; For some time it
continued prosperous, but suffered greatly in the wars between
the Danes and Northumbrians.&nbsp; The early history of all
ancient towns, chiefly &ldquo;pertains to feats of broils and
battles;&rdquo; castles founded, demolished, and rebuilt, to be
destroyed again; baronial feuds and fierce invasions; with the
faint and fruitless struggles of <i>right</i> against
<i>might</i>, make up the dark and bloody record.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>After the twelfth century, a calmer period
arrived; and, though occasionally troubled by the pest of war,
the fortunes of the now wealthy town of Manchester, have been
progressively increasing.&nbsp; From the year 1352, we may date
the commencement of its manufacturing celebrity, when a kind of
woollen cloth, made from the fleece, in an unprepared state,
called &ldquo;Manchester cotton,&rdquo; was introduced; and some
Flemish artisans, invited into England, by Edward III., settled
in the town, and brought the woollen manufacture to a
considerable degree of perfection.&nbsp; At the time of the
Reformation, an ecclesiastical commission was established at
Manchester, and exercised great intolerance, imprisoning and
executing numbers of popish recusants; another of the black and
by-gone deeds of our past &ldquo;dark ages.&rdquo;&nbsp; During
the Parliamentary war, the head-quarters of the Parliamentarian
army, in Lancashire, were fixed at Manchester, which was
fortified and defended too well for the Royalist forces to be
successful in any of their repeated attacks.&nbsp; In 1652, the
walls were thrown down, the fortifications demolished, and the
gates carried away and sold.&nbsp; The good town of Manchester
had grown great and wealthy; but we much doubt if it had become
particularly grave or wise, since we know that extravagant
rejoicings, accompanied by every splendour of pomp and ceremony,
took place at the restoration of the not-too-excellent King
Charles II., in whose honour, and to the glorification of the
thirsty woollen-weavers, the public conduits flowed with streams
of wine, instead of water; a celebration worthy of the
&ldquo;merry monarch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>In 1745, Prince Charles Edward entered Manchester
with his army, and took up his abode in the house of Mr.
Dickenson, in <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Market-street, when he levied money, raised men and
horses for his service, and after marching about the country,
made a rapid retreat into Scotland, before the army of the Duke
of Cumberland.&nbsp; The officers of the Manchester regiment,
were tried for high treason, and executed on Kennington Common,
two of the heads being placed on Temple Bar, and two on the
Exchange, Manchester.&nbsp; With this inhuman and disgraceful
event, the record of the &ldquo;fortunes of war,&rdquo; connected
with this place, ends,&mdash;we will trust for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The various manufactures carried on in Manchester, would
occupy a descriptive work of no small extent, in themselves; and
the account which so small a volume as the present can find space
for, must be brief indeed.&nbsp; The staple trade is the cotton
manufacture, which, in all its branches, is carried on to an
almost incredible extent.&nbsp; From the time of Edward III.,
when the &ldquo;Manchester cottons&rdquo; were first introduced,
this branch of trade has been increasing in importance.&nbsp;
About the year 1740, cotton was manufactured by the spindle and
distaff in the cottages of the workmen, chiefly into fustians,
thicksets, dimities, and jeans, to which other kinds of goods
were shortly added.&nbsp; About the year 1760, these goods,
hitherto made only for home consumption, formed a market on the
continent of Europe and America, and in consequence of the
increased demand, recourse was had to the aid of machinery.&nbsp;
The spinning jennies, invented by Messrs. Kay and Highs, have
been introduced, and greatly improved by Mr. Hargreaves, whose
success, exciting the apprehensions of the hand-workmen, caused
the destruction of his machinery, and his retreat to Nottingham,
where he died in indigence.&nbsp; <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Sir Richard Arkwright, the late Sir
Robert Peel, and others, have improved and invented other
machines, which, aided by the power of the steam-engine, have
prodigiously increased the quantity and variety of the goods
manufactured in this town.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the spinning department alone, there are in the town and
vicinity 114 factories, worked by 118 steam-engines, the
aggregate power of which is equal to that of 3,981 horses; by
this machinery, 2,182,350 spindles, and 6,926 power-looms are set
in motion.&nbsp; The power-looms, a recent invention, originating
with the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, of Holland House, Kent, were not
proved finally successful till 1806.&nbsp; The factories, in
several of which the whole process of the manufacture, from the
introduction of the raw material, to the completion of the
fabric, is carried on, are immense ranges of building, from six
to eight stories in height, some employing 2,000 persons each,
and the whole affording employment to upwards of 30,000
persons.&nbsp; The principal articles at present manufactured are
velvets, fustians, jeans, ticking, checks, ginghams, nankeens,
diaper, quilting, calico, muslins, muslinets, cambric
handkerchiefs, small wares, silks, and, in fact, every variety of
cotton and silk goods.&nbsp; There are also extensive bleaching
grounds, works for printing and dyeing, and all other departments
of the manufacture.&nbsp; Extensive forges, foundries, &amp;c.,
for the machinery used, laboratories for chemical productions
used in the trade, and mills for the manufacture of all
descriptions of paper; engraving, as connected with the printing
of cotton and muslin goods, is carried on to a great <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>extent; and
there are hat manufactories, and saw mills on a very large
scale.&nbsp; It is needless to inform the reader, that an
inspection of some of these immense hives of labour and
invention, will well repay the trouble of a visit.&nbsp; It is a
proud feeling to an Englishman to know, that the productions of
the thousand busy hands and whirling wheels around him, are
destined to increase the comfort, refinement, or splendour of
nations, spread far and wide over the globe: and it is a joyful
thing to compare present greatness and secure freedom, with the
long past years when a little bristling fortress and a tented
field, scenes of barbaric bloodshed and grovelling slavery,
occupied the spot of earth now devoted to usefulness, industry,
and knowledge.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Manchester is situated on the banks of the river Irwell;
(which here receives the tributary streams of the Irk and the
Medlock;) on the N.W. bank lies the newly erected borough of
Salford, connected by means of five bridges with Manchester, of
which it forms an integral part.&nbsp; In various parts of the
town there are altogether nearly sixty bridges.&nbsp; The town is
well paved, and lighted with gas; and the inhabitants are
supplied with water by the Manchester and Salford Water
Company.&nbsp; The environs, in many parts, particularly in
Broughton, Ardwick-green, and Gibraltar, are pleasant, and
present many ranges of handsome residences, tasteful villas, and
cottages.&nbsp; In the older parts of the town are several
ancient houses, interspersed with modern dwellings, and, except
where recent improvements have been made, the streets are <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>inconveniently narrow; the accommodation of trade being
more studied here than elegance and symmetry of appearance.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The public buildings and institutions of Manchester are well
worthy of its wealth and importance.&nbsp; The Exchange and
Commercial Buildings, facing the Market-place, form a spacious
handsome edifice, built of Runcorn stone: containing the
News-room, Exchange, Library, Post-office, Chamber of Commerce, a
spacious Dining-room, and other apartments.&nbsp; The members of
the Literary and Philosophical Society have a suitable building
for their meetings, and have published many volumes of
Transactions in the English, French, and German languages, which
are much circulated on the continent.&nbsp; The Royal
Institution, embracing a variety of objects connected with
literature, science, and the fine arts, has a fine building in
the Grecian style, from a design by Mr. Barry, forming a splendid
addition to the architectural ornaments of the town.&nbsp; The
centre comprises the Hall and Lecture Theatre, lighted by a
lantern from the ceiling, which may be darkened instantaneously
at the will of the lecturer.&nbsp; One of the wings is
appropriated as the Academy of the Fine Arts, with
Exhibition-rooms, and the other as a Museum of Natural
History.&nbsp; The whole cost of this elegant pile was estimated
at &pound;50,000.&nbsp; The Town Hall is a noble edifice, from a
design by Mr. F. Goodwin, after the model of the Temple of
Erectheus, at Athens, with a beautiful tower and dome in the
centre, resembling the Tower of Andronicus, called &ldquo;The
Temple of Winds:&rdquo; it contains various apartments for
transacting the <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>public business of the town, and one splendid room, 132
feet long, decorated with great elegance.&nbsp; The Town Hall at
Salford is a handsome and commodious stone edifice by the same
architect.&nbsp; The Society for promoting the study of natural
history, has a valuable and extensive Museum also; and the town
possesses flourishing Mechanics&rsquo; Institutions, Philological
Society, Agricultural Society, Botanic Garden, several Libraries,
two Theatres, Assembly-rooms, Concert-rooms, Annual Races, and
Triennial Musical Festivals.&nbsp; There are twenty-six churches
and chapels belonging to the Establishment, and more than fifty
places of worship for the various denominations of
Dissenters.&nbsp; The windows of St. John&rsquo;s Church, in
Byrom-street, contain some very ancient and beautiful stained
glass, brought from a convent in Rouen; also, pictures in the
vestry, and a fine piece of sculpture, by Flaxman.&nbsp; The Free
Grammar School, founded in the 7th of Henry VIII., has a revenue
of &pound;4,000, and the number of scholars is from 150 to
200.&nbsp; The Blue Coat, St. Paul&rsquo;s, Lancasterian,
National, and Infants&rsquo; Schools, are all highly useful, and
well-supported establishments; and the various Sunday Schools
instruct as many as 30,000 children.&nbsp; The Hospitals and
other Charitable Institutions are equally extensive in their
sphere of usefulness, and together with the establishments before
mentioned, worthy of the wealth, intelligence, and liberality of
this great and important town.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the distinguished natives of Manchester, or persons who
have been otherwise connected with it, may be enumerated, William
Crabtree, an astronomical <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>writer, and inventor of the
micrometer, born at Broughton and killed at the battle of Marston
Moor in 1644; John Byrom, a poet, and author of a system of
shorthand; John Ferriar, M.D., author of Illustrations of Sterne,
&amp;c.; Thomas Barritt, the antiquary and heraldist; Thomas
Faulkner, an enterprising traveller, who published the earliest
account of Patagonia, and died in 1774; the Rev. John Whittaker,
the Manchester historian; and others of less renown.&nbsp;
Manchester gives the title of duke and earl to the family of
Montague.&nbsp; The market days are Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday; fairs on Easter Monday and Tuesday, and October 1 and
2.&nbsp; Salford fairs begin on Whit Monday, for twenty-one days;
and on November 17, for the same time.</p>

<p><i>Explanation</i>.&mdash;To find the fare and distance from
one station to another&mdash;say Stafford to Wolverhampton.&nbsp;
Find Stafford in the first column, carry your eye along the
column opposite to which it is placed until you arrive at
Wolverhampton placed in the slanting column, and there the fare
and distance will be found.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup>&nbsp; The figures at the
top of each square denote the distance, those on the left hand
the fare by the <i>first</i> class carriages, (<i>whether in
first class or mixed class trains</i>) and those on the right
hand the fare by the <i>second</i> class carriages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Entered at Stationer&rsquo;s
Hall</i>.]</p>
<p>* The Fares from Stations above Hartford, to Stations on the
Manchester and Liverpool Line, are the same as to Manchester and
Liverpool.&nbsp; But the Fares from Hartford, Acton, Preston
Brook, Moore, and Warrington, to the Stations on the Manchester
and Liverpool Line, are in proportion to the distance.</p>
<p>The Fare from Birmingham to any Station on the Liverpool and
Manchester Line is in proportion.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The Mixed Trains also take up and set down
Passengers <i>to or from any part of the Grand Junction
Railway</i>, at all the usual Stopping Places on the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway.&mdash;An allowance is <i>included</i> in
the above Tables of five minutes for <i>all</i> the Trains at the
<i>principal</i> Stations, and of three minutes for <i>the Mixed
Trains</i>, at the intermediate stopping places.&mdash;No Fare is
less than One Shilling by the principal Trains.&mdash;The Fare
between the intermediate Stopping Places is at the rate of about
2&frac12;d. per mile for First, and 1&frac12;d. for Second Class
Passengers.&nbsp; Tables of which are kept at each of the
Stations.</p>
<p>Parties arriving at Birmingham by the early Trains, can go on
in the same carriage to the London and Birmingham Railway
Station, and so proceed by the London Train.</p>

130</span>MANCHESTER.</h3>
<h4>MANUFACTORIES.</h4>
<p>The great centre of the cotton manufacture, Manchester, will
be an object of curiosity to the stranger on this account; and he
will naturally be desirous to view some of the processes and the
operations of those mighty agents, steam and machinery, which
have added so much to the real wealth and glory of England.</p>
<p>With suitable introductions, the inquiring visiter may visit
the following establishments, where he cannot fail to be
astonished at the vast scale on which the staple manufactures are
conducted; and the remarkable order, arrangement, and cleanliness
maintained through all their departments.&nbsp; The immense
spinning mills of Messrs. McConnel &amp; Co., Henry-street,
Ancoats, will furnish to the visiter an inspection of the various
processes to which the raw cotton is subjected in the course of
its manufacture into twist, or thread for weaving.</p>
<p>In the large manufactory of the Oxford-road twist company, in
Oxford-road, he would see the processes of weaving by means of
the steam loom.</p>
<p>In the patent card manufactory of Mr. J. C. Dyer,
Stone-street, London-road, he would observe the very curious mode
of manufacturing the cards used for teasing or carding the
cotton; and in the large establishments of Messrs. Sharp,
Roberts, &amp; Co., machinists and engineers, Faulkner-street, he
would see the various manufactures of steam engines, both
stationary and locomotive, boilers, steam looms, and every other
piece of machinery required for manufacturing purposes in this
part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In another branch of manufacture, that of silk, which is of
growing importance and extent in Manchester, the visiter would be
gratified by an inspection of the silk mill of Messrs. Royle and
Crompton, Great Bridgewater-street.</p>
<h4><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>PUBLIC BUILDINGS, LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC
INSTITUTIONS.</h4>
<p>The Exchange and News Room, (now undergoing alteration and
extension, for which end, the Post Office, now at the back of the
building, is to be removed,) is situated at the foot of
Market-street.&nbsp; It is a semi-circular building, with stone
front, and the large room contains a full length portrait of
Colonel Stanley, many years member for the county.</p>
<p>The Town Hall, in King-street, is a fine structure, founded in
1822; by application to the porter, the stranger will obtain
admittance to the hall or &ldquo;large room,&rdquo; which is very
handsomely decorated with fresco paintings, and by rich
mouldings, friezes, from the Elgin marbles, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Royal Institution in Mosley-street is open twice every
year, during the exhibitions of paintings; one being limited to
those of old masters and deceased artists; the other restricted
to those of modern and living artists.&nbsp; The entrance hall
and sculpture gallery are worth notice.&nbsp; Admission a
shilling.</p>
<p>Nearly adjoining, at the back of the Royal Institution, is the
Manchester Athen&aelig;um, now in process of erection, the
members of which at present occupy the lower wing of the Royal
Institution, with an entrance in Bond-street.&nbsp; The front of
the Athen&aelig;um is also in Bond-street, and when it is
finished the two buildings will form a very pleasing proof of the
architectural resources of Mr. Barry, the architect of the two
new houses of parliament.</p>
<p>The Manchester Mechanics&rsquo; Institution is a spacious
brick edifice in Cooper-street, with large lecture theatre, good
library, and commodious class rooms.&nbsp; To the Athen&aelig;um
and the Mechanics&rsquo; Institution there is no difficulty of
access.</p>
<p>The Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, one of
the oldest and most celebrated of provincial institutions, having
been founded in 1781, has distinguished itself by its annual
volumes of published memoirs, and is now distinguished in the
person of its President, the venerable Dr. Dalton.&nbsp; Its Hall
is in George-street, nearly opposite St. James&rsquo;s Church;
but as the sittings of the society are not daily, little
information can be given <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>as to the admission of
strangers.&nbsp; Scientific men would doubtless find no
difficulty in obtaining an introduction.</p>
<p>The Museum and Hall of the Natural History Society, in
Peter-street, can only be entered on presenting an order from a
subscriber.&nbsp; The Museum is very rich in almost every
description of natural history; we believe in ornithology it is
particularly so; its collection of British birds is said to be
unequalled, and its entomological department is becoming
exceedingly extensive.</p>
<p>The Concert Hall, at the top of Lower Mosley-street, is an
elegant building, especially in the interior; having a neat stone
front.</p>
<p>In Mosley-street are the Assembly and Billiard Rooms, with a
plain and somewhat dingy exterior; but the Ball Rooms are
spacious and elegant.</p>
<p>Opposite is the Portico, so called from its large Ionic
portico fronting the street,&mdash;a Subscription Library and
News Room.&mdash;There are two other Subscription Libraries in
the upper floors of the Exchange, and a fourth in Newall&rsquo;s
Buildings, Market street, all of considerable extent.</p>
<p>In an old low building, (north of the Collegiate Church) to
which entrance is had by a small gate adjoining the Palatine
Buildings, Hunt&rsquo;s Bank, the stranger will find what will
amply repay even a hurried and hasty visit.&nbsp; This building
is named the College; in it are educated a number of boys who,
from their dress, are distinguished as the Blue Coat Boys.&nbsp;
In the upper floor of the building is a long corridor, traversing
three sides of the building, two of which are converted into a
library, the books generally being deposited in bays, or enclosed
recesses, and locked up.&nbsp; This library, which contains
upwards of 20,000 volumes, was founded by Humphrey Cheetham, who
lived in the 17th century, and is wholly free; but the books are
not to be removed from the place.&nbsp; There is a spacious
reading room at the further extremity of the library, where the
student may take his worm-eaten folio, and seating himself in an
old carved chair, may easily transport himself in fancy, two
centuries back; for the room is of oak, panelled and carved, with
old tables, chairs, and other furniture corresponding to the
period; and several old pictures of the founder and other
worthies.&nbsp; In the library, above the books, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>are
suspended various specimens of stuffed reptiles, and other
objects, which are shown to the visiter by one of the blue coat
boys, for a small gratuity; the chief curiosity in the exhibition
being the broad Lancashire dialect, and strange mode of
description, given by the little showman.</p>
<p>To the Botanic Garden, Old Trafford, Stretford Road, (to which
omnibuses convey visiters to Market-street,) the admission is by
an order from a member or subscriber; the secretary is Mr. S. E.
Cottam, Brazennose-street.&nbsp; The garden covers 17 acres, and
contains in its noble conservatories, some of the rarest and
finest exotics and tropical plants to be seen in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Zoological Gardens are about a mile and a half on the new
Bury road, whither the stranger can be conveyed by omnibus from
Market-street.&nbsp; One shilling procures admission to these
gardens, which are as extensive as those in Surrey, covering 15
acres of ground, and, although of recent foundation, they already
contain many very fine and rare animals, including a rhinoceros,
elephant, lion, tigers, &amp;c., and a very good collection of
hardy plants.</p>
<h4>PLACES OF WORSHIP.</h4>
<p><i>The Collegiate Church</i>.&mdash;The parish church of
Manchester, and generally called &ldquo;The Old Church&rdquo; by
the inhabitants, is within a short distance of the Exchange, at
the foot of Market-street, whence the stranger, by passing
through the Market Place and Old Millgate, will find himself at
the principal gateway to the church-yard, which is always
open.&nbsp; The church is a fine old edifice; in the choir are
some curious carvings in wood; the canopies for the stalls show
the taste of the artist in tracery.&nbsp; The altar piece is a
relic of the loom,&mdash;a faded pictorial representation on
tapestry, of which the colours and forms are now obscured by the
touch of time.&nbsp; There are in the church several enclosed
chapels; amongst others, one of the Earls of Derby.&nbsp; In the
south transept, near the entrance to the registry, is the spot
where, for a few short weeks, rested the remains of the gifted
and hapless Malibran,&mdash;since removed to the church of
Lacken, near Brussels.&nbsp; Passing thence to the registry, is a
mural monument, in white <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>marble, by Chantrey.&nbsp; Adjoining
the registry is the chapter-house,&mdash;the ecclesiastical
government of the parish being vested in a warden, and four
fellows constitute the chapter, and who will probably be
appointed dean and canons, when the see of Manchester is
erected.&nbsp; The parish of Manchester is of great extent,
including upwards of thirty townships.</p>
<p>Of the other churches in the town our limits admit but of a
brief notice.</p>
<p><i>St. Ann&rsquo;s</i>, in St. Ann&rsquo;s Square, is an
example of the anomalies of some ancient parishes,&mdash;it
forms, with its grave-yard, a parish of itself; and, we believe,
though standing in the very heart of Manchester, it counts but
one house in its parish.</p>
<p><i>St. Mary&rsquo;s</i>, in St. Mary&rsquo;s Street,
Deansgate, has a very fine spire, surmounted by a ball.&nbsp;
This was the scene of a feat of one of the Woottons, the steeple
climbers, who, by some simple apparatus, as ropes, climbed up the
giddy height, and removed the old ball and cross, which had been
damaged by lightning.</p>
<p><i>St. Paul&rsquo;s</i>, in Turner-street, has no
architectural pretensions, or other claims to special notice.</p>
<p><i>St. John&rsquo;s</i>, St. John&rsquo;s Street, Deansgate,
is a plain, brick edifice, once the scene of the pastoral labours
of the Rev. John Clowes, a disciple of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p>
<p><i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>, St. James&rsquo;s Street, is a brick
building.</p>
<p><i>St. Peter&rsquo;s</i>, at the foot of Mosley-street, a
handsome stone edifice, resembling a Grecian temple.</p>
<p><i>St. Michael&rsquo;s</i>, Angel-street, <i>St.
Clement&rsquo;s</i>, Lever-street, and <i>St. George&rsquo;s</i>,
St. George&rsquo;s Road, have little to tempt the stranger to
visit them, for their external appearance.</p>
<p><i>St. Matthew&rsquo;s</i>, Camp Field, is a very handsome
stone structure, in the English style of architecture, erected in
1825; and the large area in front gives the spectator room to see
its form and proportions, unimpeded by surrounding houses.</p>
<p><i>St. Andrew&rsquo;s</i>, Travis-street, London-road, is a
neat Gothic structure of stone, built in 1831.</p>
<p><i>All Saints&rsquo;</i>, in Grosvenor-square,
Chorlton-on-Medlock, was erected in 1820: it is a stone building,
standing in the midst of an enclosure, in the centre of the
Square.</p>
<p><i>St. Saviour&rsquo;s</i>, Plymouth Grove,
Chorlton-on-Medlock, is a stone <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>edifice, which is intended to
receive a tower at some future period.</p>
<p>In Salford, <i>Trinity Chapel</i>, Chapel-street, and <i>St.
Stephen&rsquo;s</i>, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street, have little to
interest the stranger.</p>
<p><i>St. Phillip&rsquo;s</i>, near the Adelphi, is a stone
edifice, with a semi-circular colonnade in front, and a circular
tower and dome of slender proportions, which have been compared
to a pepper-box.</p>
<p><i>Christ&rsquo;s Church</i>, Acton-square, beyond the
Crescent, Salford, is of stone.&nbsp; Its minister, the Rev. Hugh
Stowell, M.A., is one of the most popular preachers in the
town.&nbsp; Not a mile beyond this, is Pendleton church,&mdash;a
neat Gothic structure of stone, which from its position, is a
pleasing object from many points of view for miles round.</p>
<p><i>St. George&rsquo;s</i>, Hulme, is a specimen of the florid
Gothic in some of its architectural decorations.</p>
<p><i>St. Luke&rsquo;s</i>, Cheetham Hill, now in progress of
erection, the first stone being laid in June, 1836, is another
Gothic edifice, of some pretensions.</p>
<p>Amongst the dissenting chapels and meeting houses, those of
the Methodists and Independents are the most prominent for their
numbers and size.&nbsp; The Wesleyan Methodists have about a
dozen; of which, the principal are the chapels in Oldham-street,
Grosvenor-street (Chorlton-on-Medlock); and in Irwell-street, and
Gravel-lane, Salford.&nbsp; The New Connexion Methodists have
two; the Primitive Methodists, four; the Independent Methodists,
two; and the Methodist Association, (the seceders under Dr.
Warren,) five or six chapels in the town and suburbs.</p>
<p>The Independents have seven or eight large chapels; the
principal ones are, that in Mosley-street, the scene of the late
Rev. Dr. McAll&rsquo;s ministerial labours; that in
Grosvenor-street, in which the late Rev. Mr. Roby once
ministered; and one in Rusholme-road,&mdash;the last being the
only one of handsome exterior.</p>
<p>The Particular Baptists have three chapels; the Society of
Friends, a very large, neat building, with stone front, in
Dickenson-street; the Scotch Church is a neat stone edifice,
opposite St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, St. Peter&rsquo;s Square; the
Scotch Presbyterian, or Secession Church, in Lloyd-street and
Mount-street, is a plain brick building.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>The
Unitarians have four chapels; that in Cross-street, a large brick
building, was destroyed by a mob, in what were called the
&ldquo;Sacheverel riots,&rdquo; and parliament voted &pound;1,500
towards its re-erection.&nbsp; There is a small chapel in
Salford, in Dawson&rsquo;s Croft, Greengate; a large and very
handsome stone-fronted edifice in Bridge-street, Strangeways; and
a beautiful and spacious structure, one of the purest specimens
of the English style of architecture in the town, nearly
completed, in Upper Brook-street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, for the
congregation formerly worshipping in the Mosley-street
chapel.</p>
<p>The Swedenborgians have two chapels; one in Peter-street,
Manchester, the other in Bolton-street, Salford.&nbsp; There are
seven chapels for the Welsh, of different denominations; three,
severally called &ldquo;Christ Church,&rdquo; for particular
denominations of Dissenters; and the Jews have a synagogue in
Halliwell-street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John Conroy is to acknowledge the receipt of the
Bed and Mattress of Mr. R. Farmer&rsquo;s invention, which he has
made for the <span class="smcap">Princess Victoria</span>; and
Sir John is commanded by the <span class="smcap">Duchess of
Kent</span> to express Her Royal Highness&rsquo;s highest
approval of the principle of his Mattresses, Cushions,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kensington Palace, Dec. 17, 1830.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Richard Farmer</i>, <i>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Congreve Selwyn</span>, Esq.
<i>Surgeon of the Ledbury Dispensary</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. <span class="smcap">Congreve
Selwyn</span>, Surgeon of the Ledbury Dispensary, begs to offer
his Testimony of the value of Mr. Farmer&rsquo;s invention of his
Elastic Mattresses and Cushions. The one he has sent to Mr.
Selwyn answers all the purposes for an Invalid, and is
particularly serviceable where the patient suffers from hectic
fever and night perspirations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ledbury, May 2, 1834.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Richard Farmer</i>, <i>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Sir
William</span> B. <span class="smcap">Cave</span>, Bart.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Stretton,
Atherstone, July 22, 1835.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir <span class="smcap">Wm</span>. B. <span
class="smcap">Cave</span> has much satisfaction in informing Mr.
Richard Farmer, that the Elastic Steel Spring Bed which he
purchased from Mr. F. has fully answered every expectation he had
formed of it. Sir. W. C. lay upon it for five months without ever
being able to be moved in the least from it, and for the last six
months has not been removed from it for more than two hours at a
time, and it is now as perfect in the elasticity and strength of
the springs as when he received it from Mr. Farmer. Sir W.
Cave&rsquo;s weight is sixteen stone and upwards. Dr. Palmer, of
Birmingham, who has been in the habit of attending Sir W. Cave
for many years, gave it as his opinion, that had he been lying on
a bed of any other description, the consequences would have been
very serious.</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
